FAIOLA is Professor and Head of the Dept. of Biomedical and Health Information Sciences, and Affiliate Professor in Computer Science. Formally, he was Exec. Associate Dean at Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing, Indianapolis; and Founding Director of the Human-Computer Interaction Program. His Ph.D. is from Purdue University. He is a socio-technical scientist whose research lies at the intersection of biomedical/health informatics, and human-centered computing / human-factors). Through the empirically-grounded design of mobile health self-monitoring, he is advancing the field of consumer health informatics. He has published 100+ refereed papers and given 100+ presentations and invited keynotes/talks in the US, Europe, Russia, India, and Saudi Arabia. He has secured over $2M in grants/contracts: NSF, AHRQ, MacArthur Foundation, and the Fulbright Institute. PROJECTS: (a) A non-invasive alert-system that detects hypoglycemia (using nano-sensors) by extracting/sending biomarker data from human breath to a mHealth app that displays real-time data, and (b) A health communications mobile system that delivers patient vitals data from the bedside to caregivers.
