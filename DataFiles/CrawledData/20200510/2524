We thank our students, faculty, and staff for their patience, flexibility, and creativity during this time. Please be safe out there.  The following information reflects the current status of COVID-19 response in the School of Design:    ACADEMIC SCHEDULE UIC’s extended spring break begins Monday, March 16, and continues through Friday, March 27. Classes resume online Monday, March 30. Faculty are rapidly making the needed adjustments to class projects to deliver the required course content without need of our instructional labs. Students who successfully complete the online instruction for the current courses should expect to move forward, as planned, in the fall semester.   BUILDING ACCESS - UPDATED In light of the stay-at-home order for the State of Illinois issued on March 20 by Governor Pritzker, we have amended our building access policy. UIC Architecture + Design Studios are now locked until further notice. In the case of any emergency needs, the ADS building does remain accessible to faculty and staff by swipe access.  LOCKERS Students need not clean out their lockers. There is no hard deadline for locker clean-out and no late fees will be accessed following the previously issued May 8 deadline.    STUDENT ADVISING  Design advising services have moved fully into remote mode. Undergraduates should contact Miles Katz with any questions or concerns related to academic progress or for referrals to other campus services. Kevin Strickland , who leads student affairs for the School of Design, is available to students and faculty who have concerns about teaching progress or are in need of instructional guidance or support.     MAKING CONTACT  The Office of the School of Design is now closed. Faculty and staff have begun working remotely. We ask that you contact design@uic.edu with any questions or concerns. Students should continue to follow UIC’s announcements over the break and check their emails for updates from the University and the School.   EVENTS + EXHIBITIONS  All School of Design public events for the spring 2020 semester have been cancelled or postponed. We are anticipating a Fall 2020 Closing Reception for As, Not For: Dethroning our Absolutes , the exhibition currently on display in our 3rd floor hallway galleries.    GRADUATION + YEAR END SHOW  Sadly, all University of Illinois commencement ceremonies have been cancelled. There is a faculty/staff team preparing for a virtual Year End Show and we are working toward a special gathering of the UIC Design Class of 2020. It is too early to set a date for this event, but it is not too early to share your ideas and graphics for a post-COVID-19 celebration.    FOUNDATION REVIEW  Students in the First Year Program will undergo a remote review for consideration of acceptance into the Bachelor of Design in Graphic Design, the Bachelor of Design in Industrial Design, and the BA in Design Studies. Please stand by for updates.  COVID-19 UPDATES   The School Design will continue to forward email updates as information comes our way. UIC has deep expertise in public health and maintains a UIC coronavirus webpage with daily updates. It is also helpful to monitor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Finally, in case you haven’t seen it, The Washington Post has a cool visualization that demonstrates positive impact of social distancing.
