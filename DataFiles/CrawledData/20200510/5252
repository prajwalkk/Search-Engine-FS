Other parents who have felt the same confusion, fear, and exhaustion as you can share both practical advice and emotional support you need to move forward.  While Specialized Care for Children does not formally organize parent support groups, many parents naturally connect with one another through our services, and we do our best to help parents find others who can educate and support them. You can meet other parents by getting involved on the Family Advisory Council , or we can point you in the direction of a support group in your area or online forum. We do whatever we can to help you make these important connections.  Browse Support Resources  Or, call us at (800) 322-3722 or send us an email to learn more.
