UIC’s undergraduate programs in mechanical and industrial engineering are accredited by ABET, whose name began as an acronym for Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology.  ABET accreditation provides assurance that a college or university program meets the quality standards of the profession for which that program prepares graduates.  ABET is the recognized accreditor for college and university programs in applied science, computing, engineering, and technology. It is a federation of 28 professional and technical societies representing these fields. Among the most respected accreditation organizations in the United States, ABET has provided leadership and quality assurance in higher education for more than 75 years.  More than 100,000 students graduate from ABET-accredited programs each year, and millions of graduates have received degrees from ABET-accredited programs since 1932.  You can find the ABET program educational objectives, student outcomes, and enrollment data for our undergraduate majors on the program pages for mechanical engineering and industrial engineering .
