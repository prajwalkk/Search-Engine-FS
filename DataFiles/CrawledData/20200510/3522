Funding your education can be complex, but we’re committed to making college affordable by helping you through the financial aid process.  There are four basic types of financial aid:   Scholarships  Student employment  Assistantships and fellowships  Loans    Getting started  Most students submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to receive funding. Funds are limited in many programs, so it’s important to submit your FAFSA before UIC’s priority deadline of February 15 .

UIC Office of Special Scholarship Programs    UIC SnAP    More about UIC scholarships       Student employment   On-campus jobs don’t offer tuition wavers, but they do provide a convenient location and work schedule. The UIC Student Employment Office can help connect you with departments that are hiring.  Learn more about the employment resources available for students and view the current job listings .     Student Employment Office       Assistantships   Most of our graduate programs employ graduate students as teaching (TAs), research (RAs) or graduate assistants (GAs). TAs help with classroom instruction, lab supervision, discussion sessions and grading. RAs work with faculty members in research activities. GAs generally perform clerical work in an academic department or administrative office.  An assistantship provides a stipend, tuition waiver, certain fee waivers and the option to buy low-cost health insurance. Most students find assistantships through their programs, so contact your Director of Graduate Studies for help.      Fellowships   The university and Graduate College both offer internal fellowships . These are awards aimed at recruiting outstanding students newly admitted to graduate programs at UIC.  Consider foundations and organizations outside UIC , for specialized and competitive fellowship opportunities like the Fulbright and DAAD grants.
