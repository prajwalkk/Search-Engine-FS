The ROAAP fund provides financial support towards open access fees in open access journals.  Studies show open access increases citation and other recognition of published research.  The goals of the fund are to:   provide seamless access to UIC-authored journal articles;  support reform of traditional scholarly journal publishing;  provide support to authors who are not funded by grants or contracts  with funds to help cover open access and paid access publishing fees.    Funding for this program comes from the University Library, Office of the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, and the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research.
