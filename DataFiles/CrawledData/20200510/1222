To request a new connection for an existing wall jack (bjack), contact the  REACH representative for your department. REACH representatives are listed on the Departments A-Z page. If your department do not have a REACH representative, or they are not available, contact the Client Services Office .  If you would like a UIC-Net network connection to be added to a room in which there is not yet a wall jack, contact the Telecommunications Consulting .  Cost  Apart from the initial installation cost, the recurring cost may be covered by ACCC Department Rate and Funding.  In the residence halls, the Res-Net charges apply.
