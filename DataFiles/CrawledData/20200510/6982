How to obtain your UIC I-20 or DS-2019  All international students who will be sponsored by the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), including those students who will transfer their immigration record to UIC, must submit a completed UIC Declaration and Certification of Finances (DCF), financial documentation, and a copy of the biographical page in your passport before OIS can issue the appropriate immigration document (I-20/DS-2019) in order for you to obtain your student visa. If you are transferring to UIC from another educational institution in the United States, please indicate this information in the proper section of the Declaration and Certification of Finances (DCF).  As part of the required OIS Documents, transfer students are also required to complete the Transfer Verification Form in order to process your transfer to UIC.  Submit the OIS Documents outlined above by logging into your application summary page and following the instructions for uploading your documents. Upon review, an email notification will be sent if the submission is found incomplete or insufficient.  Transfer Verification Form Information  UIC cannot issue you an I-20 or DS-2019 until your current school has completed the Transfer Verification Form and released your record in SEVIS to the University of Illinois at Chicago: CHI214F01091000 . The form must be received by OIS as part of your OIS Documents to process your I-20 or DS-2019. Please work with your current school to properly complete the form and ensure electronic transfer of your SEVIS record.  Your SEVIS record can only be transferred to UIC once you have been admitted to the University  OIS recommends you discuss the transfer process with your international student advisor at your current institution. Be sure to discuss any interim travel or work plans, as they may affect the transfer procedure.  To expedite the processing of your I-20 or DS-2019, it is best to upload the Transfer Verification Form by logging into your application summary page and following instructions for uploading documents. However, your current school may fax the document our office, if necessary. The Office of International Services’ fax information is listed on the Transfer Verification Form.  Note: Students currently on Optional Practical Training (OPT) should be aware that your OPT authorization ends on the SEVIS release date.    xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
