The department has a tradition of strength in cell and tissue engineering, neural engineering, bioinformatics, biomedical imaging, biomechanics, and biomolecular engineering. Its 38 core faculty work alongside more than 100 affiliate faculty who represent departments across the UIC Colleges of Liberal Arts and Science, Applied Health Sciences, Dentistry, Engineering, Medicine, Pharmacy, and Nursing. UIC Bioengineering is committed to offering excellent opportunities in research and teaching across many areas of interest and expertise.  Today, UIC Bioengineering enrolls more than 100 PhD students, more than 75 MS students, and more than 350 undergraduate students. Together, they help to make UIC one of the most diverse institutions in the country—it is ranked No. 9 in the United States for diversity by U.S. News & World Report . Graduates of our undergraduate program tend to enter positions in industry (approximately 40%) or go on to professional schools (medicine, dentistry, nursing, pharmacy, law; 30%) and graduate programs (30%). Alumni of our graduate programs pursue careers in industry, academia, national research labs and medicine.  The UIC chapters of the Biomedical Engineering Society, Engineering World Health, and IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society provide an outlet for students to discuss topics in biomedical engineering and to work together on projects to promote health in the community and around the world. The UIC Bioengineering Student Journal allows students at all levels to engage in scholarly publication and get an early start on their research careers. Bioengineering faculty members support all of these groups as formal advisors and informal guides.
