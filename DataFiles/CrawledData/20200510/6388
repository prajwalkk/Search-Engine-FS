The focus is on facilitation skills and use of instructional technologies. We also provide the following: Individual or group teaching observation and feedback An additional source of confidential feedback in addition to student feedback Demonstrates and documents excellence in teaching for the promotion dossier Development of a community of learners and educators  Through confidential interaction with a trained observer, educators receive feedback on the strengths and challenges about the learning environment, learner engagement, session management, and teaching strategies based on a pre-negotiated, standardized assessment tool. Benefits for the peer observers include new perspectives and methods that they might want to incorporate into their own teaching practices. How it Works: A ‘pre-meeting’ to establish the faculty member’s specific area of focus as well as expectations. A specific date/time is set for the teaching activity observation. The teaching activity is observed. The instructor receives oral and written feedback on strengths and weaknesses including suggestions for improvement. The instructor and trained observer collaborate on a plan to improve or enhance performance. The teaching session is observed a 2nd time (ideally and if possible) and the feedback loop is complete.  Curriculum design consultation We help department chairs, block/course directors, and resident chiefs identify current faculty development offerings that may meet their needs, and to design needs assessments and other methods to discover those needs. Tailored offerings can occur within the context of an existing meeting to maximize participation. This is a useful document from Medbiquitous on Standardized Instructional and Assessment Methods and Resource Types . It lists some instructional methods and their corresponding assessment methods.
