Job Offers and Salary Negotiation     Should I accept a job offer?         joboffer1   You should carefully consider the offer and take your time to think through whether the job is a good fit for you. If you accept the offer then the employer will expect you to honor the acceptance and take the position.  Questions you may want to consider:   Do I have the job offer in writing (including job description, salary and benefit information)? If not, contact the Hiring Manager or Human Resources Representative and ask for all information in writing.    Are the employer’s values and culture similar to mine?  Did I connect with the people I met during the interview process?    Will I find the work appropriately challenging? Does the employer prioritize professional development opportunities for employees?    How does this position fit into my career/professional goals?    Even if the position isn’t the exact position I was hoping for, would I gain professional skills/experiences that will help me reach my professional goals?    Does the compensation/benefits package (salary, benefits, vacation, health and retirement plans) meet my expectations?    Does the geographic location of the job fit where I want to work?    Is there required travel and if yes, how do I feel about it?    How many hours will I be expected to work each week and does the position require work on evenings/weekends? If so, is compensation offered for evening/weekend work?   At any time if you would like to discuss a job offer, please make an appointment  to meet with or speak to a Career Advisor.        Should I negotiate the salary offer?         salary     Before you decide if you should negotiate the salary offer, you should research the average salary for similar positions, degree, industry, geographic region, and size of the employer . Many factors play a role when salaries are determined. Helpful salary resources are listed below.  Some job offers are not negotiable, and given the competitive job market and your field, it may not be wise to ask about negotiating. However, if you feel that you need to negotiate, consult with a Career Services Advisor .           NACE Salary Calculator    Glassdoor.com    O*Net Online    Payscale.com          Accepting the Job Offer         acceptoffer     When accepting an offer, it is crucial to accept an offer in writing — restating your interest and the job offer .  Any offer – verbal or written – should only be given if you plan to honor the acceptance.               After you accept the job offer - Recommendations         acceptrecommend     Recommended Actions:   Notify other employers to whom you have applied so that your applications can be withdrawn from consideration.  Contact and thank all those who helped you in your job search, including individuals who served as references and others who shared advice with you.            Career Planning Guide (thank you letters, other correspondences samples)          Declining a job offer         declineoffer     Recommended Actions:   Send a letter (or email) to inform the employer that you are declining the offer as soon as you decide you do not want the position.  Treat the employer respectfully even if you decline a job offer, you may encounter that employer in the future.  Express your gratitude for the job offer and thank the employer for the opportunity.            Career Planning Guide (thank you letters, other correspondences samples)          Requesting additional time to evaluate the job offer         delayoffer        If you feel you need additional time to decide whether to accept an offer, you can consider asking the employer for additional time.  Generally, employers will not withdraw an offer when applicants request additional time, but it is crucial to let the employer know how interested you are, and to be prepared to explain why you need additional time to make a decision. It is possible that some employers may not be willing to extend the deadline and you may need to make a decision.
