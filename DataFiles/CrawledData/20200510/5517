People can now envision a future they thought might not be possible.   UIC is a proud partner of the Dream U.S. Scholarship and we encourage transfer students to apply before the February 2020 deadline. February 27, 2020, 11:59 PM.

Please Click Here For More Information!              Go to the next slide    Go to the previous slide       UIC is deeply committed to fostering an inclusive environment for students of diverse backgrounds including undocumented students. We take seriously our public mission and land-grant commitment to not only expand educational pathways for undocumented students, but also to ensure that they have high-quality educational experiences.              Go to the next slide    Go to the previous slide       The Office of Diversity promotes greater awareness and understanding of undocumented students’ experiences (while maintaining the confidentiality of individuals) and develops campus responses and processes to address their needs related to academic success.              Rise UIC Annoucement   Important Update:  Dear students, faculty and staff,  The Illinois RISE (Retaining Illinois Students and Equity) Act was signed into law on June 21, 2019. The law grants eligibility for a subset of students who were previously ineligible for state financial aid as well as UIC grants, scholarships and tuition waivers. This subset of students includes undocumented students who are residents of the state of Illinois, transgender students who do not complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) due to the requirement that gender is listed as “at birth,” and undergraduate students who are in good academic standing but have lost their Monetary Award Program (MAP) funding because they have not reached junior standing.  Students who are now eligible under the Rise Act can apply for aid after January 1, 2020. The Illinois Student Assistance Commission (ISAC) is developing the Rise Act Application for students to determine if they are eligible based on need as well as status. Although Illinois MAP funding has been exhausted for the current academic year, the University of Illinois at Chicago plans to award the UIC Opportunity Grant to newly eligible students during Spring 2020, for up to $1,850 for tuition and fees only. This amount could change in future semesters. Any adjustments to this program in the future can be found at: https://financialaid.uic.edu/types-of-aid/grants/institutional-grants/  UIC academic units that have internal scholarships or tuition waivers for their undergraduate, graduate or professional students will also be able to expand eligibility for these opportunities on January 1, 2020.  We anticipate that the ISAC application will be available on January 1, 2020. Students must complete the application by the UIC financial aid priority date of February 15, 2020. Students enrolled at UIC during Spring 2020 will be retroactively awarded if it is determined that they are eligible based on the information provided on the ISAC application. The information provided on that application will also be used for the Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 semesters.
