For more detailed information, read the Red Theme Guidelines as well as the Accessibility section of the Red Tutorial .       Techniques to make sure your Red website is accessible    Use proper Alt description of graphics.  The Red template requires Alt description but it is important to create good Alt description. Good techniques are described at the WebAIM Page “ Alternative Text ” From WebAIM , the alt attribute should typically:  Be accurate and equivalent in presenting the same content and function of the image.  Be succinct. This means the correct content (if there is content) and function (if there is a function) of the image should be presented as succinctly as is appropriate. Typically no more than a few words are necessary, though rarely a short sentence or two may be appropriate.  NOT be redundant or provide the same information as text within the context of the image.  NOT use the phrases “image of …” or “graphic of …” to describe the image. It is usually apparent to the user that it is an image. And if the image is conveying content, it is typically not necessary that the user know that it is an image that is conveying the content, as opposed to text. If the fact that an image is a photograph or illustration, etc. is important content, it may be useful to include this in alternative text.  The Red template allows you to add your own headings within your body text.  It is imported for headings to be properly nested for accessibility purposes.  Headings needed to be in the correct order (H1, H2, H3….). WebAIM also had a good page on “ Using Headings Correctly “. Videos can be included in your UIC Red site but your videos need to be captioned and audio described for accessibility purposes.  This requirement is included in the Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act 2.0 Techniques . WebAIM also has a page “ Captions, Transcripts, and Audio Descriptions “. When adding graphics and images of text, good color contrast is important for people with visual impairments. This requirement is included in the Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act 2.0 Technique on Use contrasting foreground and background colors . Please run the Functional Accessibility Evaluator 2.0 to test your site.  You will need your UIC netid and password to run this version of the FAE. Follow the Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act 2.0 Techniques when adding content to your site. Contact the Digital Accessiblity Committee if you have further questions about making your UIC Red site accessible.
