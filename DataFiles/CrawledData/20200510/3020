Students need to check with academic advisors in the program of study for advise on actual courses.  100-300 level courses are usually open for registration to graduate students, and credit appears on the transcript for any such courses that may be taken by the student; however, these courses do not count towards graduation credit nor are they calculated into the graduate degree grade point average used by the Graduate College for academic standing/probation and graduation. The grade point average that is included on the transcript, is calculated by the student level (eg. undegraduate, nondegree, or gradaute) includes all courses (100- through 500-level) taken by the student while under a particular level, but is not used by the Graduate College. It may be advisable for graduate students to take 100- through 300-level on a Credit/No-Credit option, if this is a concern.
