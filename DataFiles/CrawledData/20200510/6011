By now, you’ve probably heard various media outlets comparing our current situation of living with COVID-19 to that of the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic. Reporters, journalists, and even bloggers have discussed the various ways people coped, thought, and lived during the 1918 flu epidemic. But how do they know what they used, thought, and did during this time?  Documentation!  Without documentation, we may never have known that the 1918 flu epidemic happened, let alone how people responded to it.  To increase the awareness of those affected by COVID-19, University Archives is asking you, the current students, faculty, and staff at the University of Illinois at Chicago, to share your stories and experiences. We want to hear how your life as a student, faculty member, or staff member has been impacted by COVID-19.  We will preserve your submissions in Special Collections & University Archives at UIC. Selected submission materials may later be used in projects like, but not limited to: class discussions, digital exhibits or future oral histories.  You can be Part of History  We are interested in gathering stories from the UIC community about how this pandemic has affected your campus and personal experience — the shift to remote instruction and learning; studying and working from home; working at on-campus and off-campus jobs; the impact of closing residence halls and other campus services; the ways you and your friends and family are staying in touch during this period of social distancing and self-quarantine; and so on.  Some ways to share your story:    Write a journal entry, poem, blog post, or even an essay detailing how you have dealt with your current situation,    record a voice memo,    save your social media posts (as a screenshot!)    take photos and/or videos of life as you see it,    create a piece of artwork, whether drawing, painting, etc.    create a multimedia work of digital storytelling    Please adhere to city, county, and state stay-at-home orders while self-documenting.  Submission Process  Please fill out our form and provide as much detail about you and your submission as you can in the areas provided. Your submission must include an email address in case we need to contact you, but the email will not become part of the public collection. You may also choose to anonymize your submission.  PLEASE BE ADVISED: Submissions that are accepted will be made publicly available to researchers.
