The Makerspace will be shut down completely until further notice. We will post updates here as they become available.  If you need any help or need access to a locker please contact us by email!  Designs and instructions to make the UIC Makerspace Face Shield: https://github.com/UIC-Makerspace/FaceShield  We have equipment and services to help support all College of Engineering undergraduate students in prototyping and manufacturing for class work and student organizations. We also support graduate research on a very limited basis (requires project approval).  If you have questions about what file types to bring, where we are located, what classes we offer, or what machines we have you can refer to the pages linked in the header for more information.  If you require accommodations, or have any apprehensions about using the Makerspace, we are here to help! Please email us and we will work with you to find or create accommodations that best suit your needs.
