The following information is provided regarding appropriate  use of attorneys to represent UIC, UIC departments, and/or their foreign  faculty, staff, students or scholars.     Role of the Office of International Services (OIS)   The Office of International Services is responsible for serving the  needs of    international students, scholars, faculty and staff at UIC,  as well as their    sponsoring departments. OIS provides orientations,  workshops and advising for    our clients on topics including but not  limited to the university, the United    States, maintaining legal  status, obtaining work permission, travel, and adjusting    to life in a  different culture. The office also provides consultation and workshops     for sponsoring departments on hiring international faculty and staff,  and the    UIC policy for sponsorship of permanent residence. In  addition, the office is    charged with the processing of all  applications/petitions that require “sponsorship” by UIC. These  include: I-20s/DS-2019s and employment-based petitions requesting H-1B,  E-3, TN,    O-1, and permanent residency. The office is responsible     for insuring that the University’s interests are accurately represented     in all immigration-related applications to government agencies.     Role of the Department   Departments who wish to sponsor nonimmigrant faculty, staff and  scholars must work with OIS to complete necessary forms (most of which  are available at the OIS website) in a timely fashion so that OIS can  obtain the appropriate immigration documentation necessary for  sponsoring the foreign individual. Departments should not sign  any G-28 “Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative”  form or United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) forms  without consulting with OIS. Completion of OIS forms does not constitute signing immigration documents.     Role of Attorneys   Attorneys MAY NOT represent UIC employees or their sponsoring    departments in preparing or filing any of the following types of petitions:   Labor Certification of any kind and Permanent Residence applications based      on Labor Certification  Permanent Residence applications for Outstanding Researchers/Professors  H-1B petitions  O-1 petitions  TN petitions  Other petitions or documents that involve University employment   Attorneys MAY represent UIC employees and students in preparing    or filing the following cases:   Waiver petitions of section 212(e) two year home residence requirement  Permanent Residence applications based on National Interest  Permanent Residence applications based on Extraordinary Ability  Permanent Residence applications based on family  Permanent Residence applications based on the Visa Diversity Lottery   All immigration related forms, applications and petitions  which are    required by law or regulation to be filed by or on behalf  of the University    of Illinois at Chicago must be prepared and filed  by the Office of International    Services.     Typical Requests   Departments are, on occasion, asked by employees or their attorneys  to sign    forms or documents to support waivers of the 2-year home  residence requirement    and/or permanent residence petitions. Although  J-1 Exchange Visitors may hire    attorneys to help them obtain  waivers, departments should not sign waiver applications. Permanent  residence (commonly referred to as “Green Card”) applications    based  on UIC employment should be initiated by departments working with OIS     to obtain approvals. Attorneys should not be involved in these    cases.  Departments should not sign applications prepared by attorneys for permanent    residence applications filed on the basis of:   National Interest  Extraordinary Ability  Family Based  Visa Diversity Lottery   These applications do not require UIC employment, and are considered  “self”    petitions. Signing documents for these types of petitions is  strictly forbidden,    as it could impose legal obligations on the  university of which departments    may be unaware.  Departments may not sign the following forms:   G-28 Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative (a blue      form)  I-129 Petition for A Nonimmigrant Worker  I-140 Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker  PERM Application for Alien Employment Certification  Other immigration related documents, petitions or forms which promise UIC      employment        Exceptions   If you believe you have a case which merits special consideration,  please bring    it to the attention of the Director of the Office of  International services    who will be happy to discuss the specifics of  that situation.    xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
