Harrison St., Room 235 Chicago, Il, 60607  Margaret Fink, Ph.D., Director  mfink3@uic.edu  Directions to the DCC from the Harrison Street Entrance to the Behavioral Sciences Building (BSB):  Using Stairs:  When you enter the front doors of the building, continue going straight past the hallway to the food court on your left. The hallway that you encounter just inside the front doors will bend around to the right slightly, leading you to a set of staircases in the middle of the building, with several staircases ascending from the ground level to a round landing and then another set of staircases leading to the second floor in various directions. Take the first set of stairs that you come to when proceeding from the front door to the first landing. There will be another set of stairs directly in front of/across from you when you hit the landing. Take that set of stairs to the second floor. At the top of the stairs, take an immediate left, and then take your first right, past the men’s restroom on your right and continue straight directly into the center, room 235.  Using Elevator:  When you enter the front doors of the building, continue going straight past the hallway to the food court on your left. The hallway that you encounter just inside the front doors will bend around to the right slightly, leading you to a set of staircases in the middle of the building. When you get to the staircase in the middle of the building, continue around to the right until you reach the first grouping of couches and chairs. There will be two doorways on either side of the couches and chairs. Continue through one of the doorways to reach the area where the elevators are located. As soon as you enter the elevator lobby, there will be a bank of two elevators either on your right- or left-hand side, depending on which door way you go through. (There is another bank of two elevators on the opposite side of the lobby, but it is likely easier to take the bank closest to the entrance up). Take the elevator up to the second floor. When you exit the elevator, take an immediate left, and then take another immediate left before you enter the hallway to the psychology department. Go through the doorway and there will be another grouping of chairs and couches on your left. Pass the chairs and couches on your left and take your first right in front of the railing overlooking the staircases in the middle of the building. Then take the first right after that and you will come to the DCC in room 235.       Google Maps image     Disability Cultural Center   1007 W.
