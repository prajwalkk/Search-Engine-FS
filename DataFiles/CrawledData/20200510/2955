Scott  Program Codes:  20FS5085MEE    The demand for energy engineers continues to grow.  The energy industry, from creating energy efficient buildings to storage to power production, is covered in the master’s program. Whether students are concerned with HVAC design, energy efficiency, management of engineering projects as well as power from production to storage to delivery, upon graduation they will have knowledge that can be immediately applied on the job. Students will expand their career opportunities when they increase their energy engineering knowledge with a Master of Energy Engineering degree.
