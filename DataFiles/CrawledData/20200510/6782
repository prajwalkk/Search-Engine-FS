We encourage you to have your course approved by an advisor at your home institution before you register for it at UIC. You will want to provide your home college advisor with the course descriptions and syllabi for approval.  Your advisor may also request a course syllabus. Many academic departments post syllabi on their Web sites. You can check the appropriate academic department Web site to see if it is available online. If you cannot find a syllabus posted online, contact the Summer Session Office and we’ll contact the instructor to see when the syllabus will be available. We may also be able to provide you with a syllabus from a previous semester to assist you with your course selection.         Have a question? Chat live with Summer Session Staff!
