Mystical beliefs were a significant part of the practice of alchemy in civilizations dating back to the fourth millennium BCE, and grew into Western Europe by the end of the twelfth century. Though alchemy was controversial and frequently illegal to practice, it provided a basis for valid scientific experiments and influenced medicine.  "Alchemy, The Great Work” examines how the ideas and technologies of the field were fundamental to the development of modern pharmacology and features rare books, documents and artifacts related to alchemy from Special Collections and University Archives at the Library of the Health Sciences-Chicago.  "Alchemy, The Great Work" is on display at the Library of the Health Sciences-Chicago on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd floors and is open to the public during regular library hours through Dec. 2020. For more information, contact Special Collections and University Archives at (312) 996-8977.
