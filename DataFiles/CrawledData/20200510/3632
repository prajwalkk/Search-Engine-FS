In its half century of existence, our college has grown from three programs to a top-ranked, research-based business school with an international reputation. We have built highly regarded departments in all areas and continue to be recognized by the business community for our outstanding graduates.  We are UIC Business because of you and your support!

Even after graduation, our alumni continue to be actively involved with UIC Business and its students – both on and off campus.  UIC Business alumni serve as mentors for current students, as volunteer in Alumni 4 U, and speakers for the Executives in the Classroom and the Business Career Center . They host students at their place of work or take them out to dinner for networking opportunities.  They love UIC Business and the opportunities it presented to them, so they make every effort to keep their Flames spirit alive by giving students access to experiences that enhance their business education.      Take Their Word for It:    I believe supporting UIC, a top educational institution in Chicago and the nation, is a privilege and a duty. UIC equips our youths’ future through a rigorous academic and social conscience education.
