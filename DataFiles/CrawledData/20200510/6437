Terri Weaver | Dean, UIC College of Nursing        Visit the event site       PNL narrative pt. I   Origin of the Power of Nursing Leadership luncheon  On a November day in 1998, nurse leaders from all over Illinois made their way to the Chicago Cultural Center in the Loop. They assembled there for a celebration that would become a highlight of every fall for more than two decades: The Power of Nursing Leadership event.  The event was conceived by then dean Joan Shaver, PhD, RN, FAAN who felt that the UIC College of Nursing had an obligation as the major source of remarkable nurse leaders in Illinois.  “We have decided to act on the college’s responsibility, by virtue of our rank, positions and legacy, and by virtue of the positions its alumni have assumed,” wrote Shaver in the spring 1998 issue of the college’s magazine, Vital Signs , where she announced the first Power of Nursing Leadership event. She went on to write that the event “will celebrate both the development and recognition of nursing’s collective leadership in the state and beyond.”  By its 10th anniversary, the Power of Nursing Leadership event had moved to the Hilton Chicago’s Grand Ballroom to accommodate the more than 600 participants.  Over the years, the event has featured inspiring keynotes from celebrated voices including writer Maya Angelou (2002), journalist Linda Ellerbe (2004), attorney Ted Kennedy Jr. (2010) and former U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher (2011).  “I’m proud to be continuing this indispensable  event,” says Terri Weaver, now dean of the College of Nursing. “It’s vital that we take one day each year to laud the impact of nurse leaders who are shaping healthcare.”          About    Back to main content           Our Story    Our Faculty    Leadership Executive Team     External Advisory Board      Academic Departments     Biobehavioral Health Science     For AGNP Preceptors: Current and Future    BHS Faculty    BHS Staff      Health Systems Science     HSS Faculty    HSS Staff      Women, Children and Family Health Science     WCFHS Faculty    WCFHS Staff        Global Health     WHO Designations    Legends in UIC Global Health    International Scholars & Non-Degree Students      Diversity & Inclusion    Power of Nursing Leadership    Job Openings    Accreditation    Student Resources     Registration    Undergraduate Forms    Graduate & Professional Forms    Student Success Program    Scholarships     PhD Research Awards    International Experience Awards    The Skelly Fund      Student Organizations    Graduating Student Awards    Commencement     Frequently Asked Questions    Commencement information for guests        Faculty & Staff Resources    Office of Academic Programs    Global Health Leadership Office    Office of Research Facilitation     Research Development Support    Research Seminars    Faculty Funding Opportunities      Contact Us              College of Nursing  UI Health                        UIC's seven health sciences colleges and health care delivery enterprise.
