Our goal is to develop, field test and disseminate employment training and capacity-building programs that will improve vocational rehabilitation and employment options for refugees with disabilities in Illinois and elsewhere.           Core and Primary Partners  PRIDE would not be successful without the support from our core and primary partners PRIDE depends on collaboration with our core and primary partners, who work shoulder-to-shoulder with PRIDE’s team to develop employment pathways for refugees with disabilities. These partners include a mix of community non-profit organizations and public service agencies. Read More     Complimentary Partners  PRIDE is also supported by a large number of complimentary partners. Some are instrumental in helping us make our products culturally relevant and linguistically accessible. Others help PRIDE connect with refugee communities, businesses, potential employers, and employment-related resources. Read More     Advisory Board  PRIDE’s efforts are assisted by two advisory boards, a Community Advisory Board and a Business Advisory Board. Both boards include representatives from partner agencies as well as independent volunteers from PRIDE’s target communities. The boards guide PRIDE as we evaluate our policies and practices and develop new, customized employment programs at selected partner sites.

Both training programs will include information and resources relevant for each target audience. Our IRB-approved training programs have been fully developed and are posted on a password protected platform for all project participants enrolled in our PRIDE project.   More                       Employment Resources and Tools   PRIDE is currently in the process of developing a comprehensive vocational assessment inventory (VAI). The VAI will help refugee service providers get a complete picture of their clients’ vocational interests, skill sets, and resource needs. This information will help service providers develop a personal employment plan for each client.  PRIDE is also developing an information technology tool that will help services providers connect clients with the community resources most relevant to their unique needs.  The VAI and the IT tool are currently under development and will be posted to this website when they are ready for dissemination.   More    Library of Resources & Connections  PRIDE seeks to create a library of resources and connections to help job-seeking refugees with disabilities.   More    Employer Links  PRIDE wants to connect disabled refugees with employers who are willing and eager to hire job-seekers with disabilities. Please check this page for links to organizations and employers who have hired people with disabilities or are interested in doing so.
