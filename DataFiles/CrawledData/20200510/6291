Postdoctoral Fellowship       The primary qualifications for this program include a commitment to an oral science research career, previous academic achievement and research potential. The MOST Program is accepting applications for fellowships for both:  non-degree seeking trainees – individuals whose terminal degrees are DDS, MD or PhDs  degree-seeking postdoctoral trainees – individuals with either DDS or MDs, enrolled in a PhD program.  UIC is dedicated to increasing the participation of individuals currently underrepresented in the biomedical and clinical sciences, as diversifying the student and faculty bodies improve the quality of the training and educational environment.  Applicants must be United States citizens, non-citizen nationals or individuals lawfully admitted for permanent residence who possess an Alien Registration Receipt Card (I-151 or I-551, or some other verification of legal admission as a permanent resident). Individuals on temporary or student visas are not eligible for admission. Former or current principal investigators on any NIH research project grant or project leaders on sub-projects of program project (P01) or center grants (P50) are NOT eligible for the MOST program.  How to Apply  Prepare a letter of intent that includes the following items and email to Dr. Bedran-Russo , MOST Program Director.  Name and previous degrees  Name of main advisor  Brief description of current research description.

Predoctoral PhD/DMD       We are currently accepting applications for a pre-doctoral graduate fellowship in the T32 Multi-Disciplinary Oral Sciences Training Program (MOST). The core research areas are in biomedical sciences to advance craniofacial-oral-dental research including craniofacial biology, tissue regeneration, tissue engineering, biomaterials, oral cancer, microbiology, immunology, and translational research.  The primary qualifications for this program include a commitment to an oral science research career, previous academic achievement and research potential. UIC is dedicated to increasing the participation of individuals currently underrepresented in the biomedical and clinical sciences, as diversifying the student and faculty bodies improve the quality of the training and educational environment. Applicants must be United States citizens, non-citizen nationals or individuals lawfully admitted for permanent residence who possess an Alien Registration Receipt Card (I-151 or I-551, or some other verification of legal admission as a permanent resident).  Individuals on temporary or student visas are not eligible for admission.  Although the straight DMD program requires that all applicants must be Illinois residents, the PhD/DMD program continues to accept out-of-state residents. However, applicants (both in-state and out-of-state) must contact Angelica Alvarez prior to applying in order to be considered for the dual program.  How to Apply  Individuals interested in pursuing a dual DMD/PhD degree and trainee fellowship support through the MOST program must first be accepted to both the DMD program and a UIC PhD program. Interested candidates must submit separate applications for both the PhD and the DMD programs.

Craniofacial Pathobiology  Leading interdisciplinary investigations in the development and function of the craniofacial complex including processes that occur within cells and tissues to maintain health and control growth and development; understanding how alterations (genetic/environmental) result in disease (cancer) and study of microbiome/host interactions.    Regenerative Science  Moving beyond tissue replacement, using materials to enable our bodies to regenerate damaged and failing tissues. We are leading investigations into how materials interact with living tissues, and the building of tissue replacements for the growth of cells/tissues to replace lost tissues. The Center for Wound Healing and Tissue Regeneration (CWHTR) is a unique community of scientists and clinicians devoted to the study of injury, wound healing, and regeneration. The Laboratory of Applied Dental Biomaterials and Interfaces is a NIH funded center studying the properties of the tooth in order to develop reparative/regenerative biomaterials to replace lost tooth structure.    Clinical, Translational & Community  Leading transformative studies to improve oral health outcomes both in the clinic and the community. We have several centers and investigators focused on the study of the incidence and prevalence of disease; measuring outcomes of interventions; and safety and efficacy of drugs, devices, and treatments in individuals. We are also investigating how and why efforts to promote oral health through intervention are accepted by communities. The Oral Medicine and Pharmacognosy Research (OMPR) Laboratory focuses on medical anthropology and ethnopharmacology to study the non-destructive radiation in oral diagnostics and forensics. The Dental Medicine Responder Training (DMRT) is performing theory and policy research supporting dental professionals for emergency preparedness throughout the community.
