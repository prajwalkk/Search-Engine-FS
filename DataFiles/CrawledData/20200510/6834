THE CURRENT DIPLOMAT IN RESIDENCE:   Ronald Packowitz is the current Diplomat in Residence. For more information and to contact Ronald please visit https://careers.state.gov/connect/dir/midwest/ .  “One of the highlights of my Foreign Service career was leading the Embassy team that assisted American victims of the 2017 terrorist attacks in the United Kingdom. When Americans are caught up in a crisis overseas—whether terrorism, a natural disaster, or a transportation accident—consular teams provide invaluable help that eases suffering for those directly affected and for their loved ones back home. It can be draining, heart-rending work, but there is immense satisfaction and pride that comes from having supported your compatriots during what may be the most distressing moments of their lives.”        Ronald S.
