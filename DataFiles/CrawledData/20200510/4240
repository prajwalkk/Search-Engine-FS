The program will be jointly supported by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Departments of Biological Sciences and Psychology and administered by the Department of Biological Sciences.  The Major in Integrated Health Studies provides students the opportunity to explore the complexity of human health, from the level of the gene to society, by providing a diverse, interdisciplinary curriculum that includes core content spanning the life sciences, natural sciences, social sciences, and the humanities. As a more holistic perspective of health has evolved, the training of health professionals has evolved as well. Students will graduate with a broad understanding of human structure and function in health and disease across the lifespan; a broad understanding of how human health and disease are impacted by culture, the environment, society, and personal behavior; and an appreciation for health issues that are unique to the urban environment and to the global society. Upon completion of the bachelor’s degree, graduates will be competitive for admission into professional and graduate health-related programs or entry into health-related careers.
