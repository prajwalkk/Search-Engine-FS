This process does not apply to grievances arising from a fellow student’s actions or alleged disciplinary misconduct .  The Student Academic Grievance Policy and Procedures were revised effective April 27, 2017. For details on the specific deadlines, procedures, and guidelines for eligibility that must be followed by both students and the faculty or administrators involved, see:      UIC Student Academic Grievance Policy        Policy  UIC Student Academic Grievance Policy          Procedures  UIC Student Academic Grievance Procedures          Forms  UIC Student Academic Grievance Forms           UIC Student Academic Grievance Policy   Students lose their right to continue to the next step of the procedures if they miss a deadline, but may automatically appeal to the next higher level if the grievance has not decided by the appropriate University officer within the administrative deadline. Only the Chancellor may make an exception to a deadline in these procedures, and will only consider such a step for extraordinary reasons.  For students who wish to report discrimination or harassment, you should contact the Office for Access and Equity.
