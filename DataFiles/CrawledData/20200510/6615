The existence of the free exchange of ideas and the expression of dissent within the university community are indications of intellectual vitality and social awareness. Freedom of speech in this context will include all forms of communication and artistic expression as well as the freedom to listen, watch, protest, or otherwise participate in such communication (“open expression”).  Implicit in these freedoms is the right to demonstrate in a peaceful and non-disruptive manner. The university affirms the right of members of the university community to assemble and demonstrate peaceably and expects that those who enjoy these freedoms must also accept responsibility for their open expression activities. To promote the free exchange of ideas, the University of Illinois at Chicago acknowledges the right of members of the university community to distribute visual communications and to speak publicly on campus, subject to the reasonable time, place and manner restrictions set forth in this policy.  The university affirms that the substance or the nature of the views expressed is not an appropriate basis for any restriction of an assembly or a demonstration. As such, the content neutral rules set forth in this policy are intended to protect the rights of those involved in these activities, others in the university community, and the institution from unreasonable disruption. The policy is not intended, nor shall it be used by the university, for prior review of any communication. The use of the university grounds and/or facilities does not imply acceptance or endorsement by the university of the views expressed as part of any open expression activity. The university reserves the right to amend this policy as appropriate .  Conduct during an Open Expression Activity  In exercising its responsibility to provide and maintain an atmosphere of free inquiry and expression, the university may establish time, place, and manner restrictions for the purpose of avoiding activity that may significantly interfere with the lawful rights of others and/or substantially impede university operations, including activity which:  * Denies or infringes upon the lawful rights of students, faculty, officers, staff, guests, or patients of the university community.  * Substantially interferes with instruction, research, administration, health care services, and other activities of the university community.  * Obstructs or restricts free movement of persons on the campus, in campus buildings, and in off campus locations where university activities take place.  * Restricts access and the use of offices, classrooms or other facilities to students, faculty, officers, staff, guests, or patients of the university community.  * Endangers or threatens the safety of any person in the university community, including use of force and/or violence.  * Destroys, defaces, or causes the loss of property.  * Violates the law and/or university policies.  Policy Application  This policy applies to all members of the university community.  Individuals/groups that are not members of the university community may only participate in an open expression activity on campus if they are sponsored by a university department or organization. The university sponsor of an outside individual or group is responsible and may be held accountable for any non-compliance by those they sponsor.  This policy does not apply to the rental of university facilities by individuals or groups that are not members of the university community as such rentals are considered private events and are governed by the university’s facility use policies.  Visual communications used in connection with university programs and services are the responsibility of the appropriate university colleges, departments, or originating units and are not covered by this policy. Other visual communications used or circulated at the university are subject to this policy.  All members of the university community are expected to know and follow the Policy on Open Expression. The university reserves the right to withdraw the permission granted to any person who violates this policy, and any member of the university community who violates this policy may be subject to disciplinary and/or criminal action.  Reason for Policy:  The Policy on Open Expression informs the university community regarding the free exchange of ideas and the expression of dissent within the University of Illinois at Chicago. Freedom of speech in this context will include all forms of communication and artistic expression as well as the freedom to listen, watch, protest, demonstrate, or otherwise participate in such communication (“open expression”).
