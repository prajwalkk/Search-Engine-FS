Student organizations you’ve joined: Service Leaders , Engineering Design Team , Society of Women Engineers , and American Society of Mechanical Engineers .  Favorite course: ME 205 (Intro to Thermodynamics)  How is the College of Engineering preparing you for the working world? With courses such as ME 347 (Intro to Computer-Aided Design) and Senior Design , we get true insight into the real world of engineering. Extracurricular activities are the cherry on top, where we can put our skills into practice and see them come to life.       Joanna Tan      Mechanical Engineering, BS ’20 | Skokie, IL  Favorite thing about the department you’re majoring in: The ME 250 (Intro to Engineering Design and Graphics) lab, with its access to 3D printing, project work space, a computer lab, and a wood shop.  What is the most valuable student organization you’ve joined, and why? Engineering World Health was my first real-world application at UIC where I felt like I was making a difference in the world. I met some of the nicest and most driven people in engineering.  Place you’re most likely to be found on campus, and why: SEL [Science and Engineering Laboratories building], because it’s my second engineering home. I work there as an undergraduate TA. Many of my classes are there, and it has comfy lounge areas and lab space to experiment.  What do you hope to be doing right after graduation? I hope either to get a master’s degree in energy engineering or begin working for an engineering company.       Adrian Arif Rahardja      Mechanical Engineering, BS ’20 | Surabaya, Indonesia  Why did you choose UIC College of Engineering? The college is growing rapidly, and it offers great student activities.  Engineering project/assignment you did that you’re most proud of: Being a part of UIC’s Engineering Design Team (EDT) and winning second place.  Most challenging engineering project/assignment you’ve conquered so far: Finishing a prototype CAD model for my ME 250 (Intro to Engineering Design and Graphics) final project.  What is the most valuable student organization you’ve joined, and why? EDT because I am able to learn engineering skills and be a part of a team.
