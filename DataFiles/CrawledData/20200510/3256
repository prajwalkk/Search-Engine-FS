Student Center East (SCE) has a large variety of food options, meeting spaces and services such as the University Bookstore and The Alley Bowling & Billiards.  This makes SCE a great destination for thousands of students and other members of the University community.  Student Center West (SCW) provides many of the same services on a smaller scale, that focuses on the unique needs of the medical students on the west campus.  Food, lounge spaces and meeting rooms comprises the bulk of the space at SCW.  We hope you will visit and return often, getting involved in Student Life (@UIClife) is one of the strongest predictors of success and graduation!  We welcome your thoughts and suggestions on how we can continue to help maintain an exceptional UIC experience.      The Student Centers serves as the heart of UIC, where leading, campus life, and community building are fostered through programs and opportunities for involvement and engagement, healthy activities, convenient services, sustainable initiatives and high quality facilities.
