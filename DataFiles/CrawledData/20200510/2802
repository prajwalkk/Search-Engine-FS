Faculty or staff who disagree with a student’s academic accommodation or who are having difficulty implementing accommodations are also encouraged to reach out directly to the DRC contact person listed on the top of the student’s Letter of Accommodation (LOA) for immediate assistance.  If outreach to the DRC contact person does not resolve the issue, an individual may file a complaint by following the step-by-step process outlined below.  Individuals, including employees, students, visitors, and members of the public, who believe that they have been subjected to unlawful discrimination or harassment of any kind are encouraged to contact the Office for Access and Equity at 312-996-8670 or oae@uic.edu.  Step 1. If an informal resolution cannot be reached, the complaint should be submitted to the Disability Resource Center Director at drc@uic.edu through written or recorded means.  Step 2. The Disability Resource Center Director, or their designee, will meet with the complainant within seven (7) business days of the receipt of the complaint.  Step 3. If Step 2 does not resolve the complaint, the Director, or their designee, will forward the complaint, within three (3) business days of the Step 2 meeting, to the Associate Chancellor in the Office for Access and Equity.  Step 4. The Associate Chancellor in the Office for Access and Equity, or designee, will meet with the complainant within seven (7) business days of the receipt of the complaint and, upon review, investigation, or other action, provide a recommendation to the Director of the Disability Resource Center.  Step 5. The Director will provide written notice to the complainant within three (3) business days of receipt of the Associate Chancellor’s recommendation, and take necessary steps to implement the recommendation.  Note: The timelines set forth are intended to ensure a timely review and resolution of a complaint. There are, however, many factors that may affect the length of time needed to resolve the complaint.                   UIC Logo        Disability Resource Center       Contact   1200 W.
