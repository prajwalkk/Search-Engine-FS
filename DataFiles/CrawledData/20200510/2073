COVID-19 Updates and Resources         Breadcrumbs   Honors College    Involvement    Chicago Signature Honors Program        Chicago Signature Honors Program       About   Chicago Signature Honors Programming is a great way for UIC Honors students to experience amazing cultural and educational opportunities outside of class at no cost! Pioneered by Dr. Ekaterina Pirozhenko, it is currently run by Honors College’s Program Coordinator & Assistant to the Dean, Tyler Nielsen.  This extracurricular initiative engages students with the cultural and intellectual diversity that only Chicago can provide. The program engages students intellectually, culturally, and artistically, while also providing students with mentoring outside the traditional classroom and office setting.  In the past, students have enjoyed performances at the Lyric Opera, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Steppenwolf, the Goethe Institute, Prop Theatre, the Athenaeum Theatre, the Mercury Theatre, UIC Theatre, the Hellenic Museum, the National Museum of Mexican Art, Christkindlmarket, Chinatown, and Little Village, and often are able to speak with players, directors and artists — all at no cost to the students.       COVID-19 Update | March 17th, 2020   In response to public health concerns surrounding COVID-19, all upcoming CSHP events have been suspended in the best interest of students, fellow patrons, and the artistic community. We hope you will join us again another term!       Policy and Rules   Attendance to Chicago Signature Honors Programming events is open to all students currently enrolled in the Honors College at the University of Illinois-Chicago.  Each event listing has an RSVP link. By RSVP’ing, you are committing to going to the event sponsored through Honors College. Upon registration you will receive a confirmation from the system letting you know that you have either A) registered successfully or B) have been placed on a waitlist as the event has already reached capacity. Those who registered successfully will receive an email at least 48 hours prior to the outing with critical information regarding directions, guidelines and information on how to obtain your ticket.  As college funds are allocated for and spent on this educational program based on RSVP counts, it is your responsibility to show up to the event that you signed up for. If you are unable to attend an event after registering, please get in touch with the administrators who run the program as soon as possible (via cshp@uic.edu, no later than 8am the day of the event) so that your ticket may be given to the next person on the wait-list. Students who fail to attend an event for which they have RSVP’d without timely communication to the program administrators of said non-attendance, will require the student to reimburse the Honors College for the cost of their ticket, as a ticket was been wasted that could have instead been used to sponsor another student’s experience.  All questions and concerns should be directed to cshp@uic.edu       Events                 Involvement    Back to main content           Student Organizations    Student Publications    Service Opportunities     Honors Ambassadors    Honors Tutoring      Honors Housing    Honors Societies    Honors College Events     Convocation      Chicago Signature Honors Program                   UIC Logo         Honors  College           Admissions    First Year Applicants    Transfer Applicants    Continuing Applicants    Scholarships for Incoming First-Year Students    Scholarships for Incoming Transfer Students      Current Students    HARS Login    Scholarships    Current Fellows    Tutoring    Graduation Information      Other Resources    Office of External Fellowships    Office of Undergraduate Research    UIC SnAP    Study Abroad    Guaranteed Professional Program Admissions    Career Services        Miscellaneous    Information for Alumni         Contact   828 South Halsted Street, 102 Burnham Hall, Chicago, IL 60607  Phone: (312) 413-2260  Fax: (312) 413-1266  hcollege@uic.edu        Social Media Accounts    Facebook    Twitter             UIC.edu links   UIC.edu  Academic Calendar  Athletics  Campus Directory  Disability Resources  Emergency Information  Event Calendar  Job Openings  Library  Maps  UIC Safe Mobile App  UIC Today  UI Health  Veterans Affairs        Powered by Red 2.38.0  © 2020 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois |  Privacy Statement    Campuses   University of Illinois System  Urbana-Champaign  Springfield      Cookie Settings
