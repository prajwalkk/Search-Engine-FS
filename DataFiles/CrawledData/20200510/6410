Why see a nurse practitioner for care?  It’s a fine question, and we have a simple, honest answer: Nurse-led care is holistic, patient-centered care.  Nurse practitioners, also known as advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs), focus on comprehensive, coordinated and continuous care for acute and chronic health problems to help patients reach their top level of health and recovery from physical and mental illnesses. At our clinic, APRNs communicate effectively with patients and treat them as partners in their own healthcare.  Their origins as RNs make nurse practitioners natural collaborators. Ours work closely with a variety of community partners , community resources and referral sources to assure community-based comprehensive and collaborative care to individuals. Our nurse practitioners diagnose and treat acute and chronic illnesses, and they focus on health promotion, disease prevention, counseling and patient education.
