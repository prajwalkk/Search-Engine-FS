I was able to showcase my work and attend multiple sessions that covered current issues and future directions in the field of outcomes research.”    Alem Asfaw | PhD Candidate          Michelle        “Thank you to the College of Pharmacy for awarding me this travel grant and allowing me to experience APhA Annual 2018 in Nashville, TN.  I was able to connect with fellow pharmacy leaders from across the world and see one of my favorite professors and mentors Dr. Wilken give a talk about COPD. Thank you so much to UIC College of Pharmacy for making this trip possible.”    Michelle Smith | Class of 2019          Paula        “The Student Travel Award means that I can present my research at ASHP’s Midyear Meeting and network with residency programs from across the country. Students come here because we care about the organization, our school, and about fulfilling our professional oath.
