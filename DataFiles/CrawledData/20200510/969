Education. Awareness. Linkage to care.   Approximately 4,300 individuals in Chicago are HIV positive and don’t know it. Individuals unaware of their status miss a critical opportunity to start therapy at an early stage of the disease, when it works best, and they unknowingly transmit HIV to their partner(s).  Around 3.2 million people are currently living with chronic Hepatitis C, HCV, in the United States. Of the 3.2 million, 3 in 4 do not know they have HCV, thus unknowingly transmitting the disease to others. Symptoms may not show for years after infection, similar to HIV, thus the need for routine HCV testing.  The University of Illinois Health and Hospital Systems is proud to announce that the Department of Emergency Medicine is taking action to curb the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Chicago. As of November 18th, 2014, the UI Health Emergency Department offers routine opt-out testing to all patients between 13-64 years old, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).  Beginning July 2015, Project HEAL is partnering with the UI Health Liver Clinic to improve HCV screening, linkage to care, and treatment across UI Health.  The following video demonstrates the opt-out HIV testing model that is being used in UIC’s Emergency Department and explains the importance of routine HIV testing.
