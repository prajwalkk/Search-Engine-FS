Daley Library           International Open Access Week is Oct. 21-27, 2019. Organized by the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC), Open Access Week is an opportunity for the global academic and research communities to learn more about and share with others the benefits of open access to information. Delivering information through open access venues speeds discovery, increases use and facilitates the flow of knowledge around the world.  Learn more about how you can benefit from and contribute to open access resources and initiatives by participating in the UIC University Library’s Open Access Week activities:  Webinar: Scholarly Publishing: Selecting scholarly publishing venues to maximize your impact while avoiding “predatory publishers”  Do you wonder how to select a journal in which to publish or wonder about the quality of a journal?  This session will demonstrate tools to identify potential journals in your field, how to determine impact factors for journals (Journal Citation Reports, Scimago), how to find where a journal is indexed for dissemination and tools to evaluate the quality of journals.  Reputable, peer-reviewed Open Access journals are on the rise, but so are “predatory publisher” that charge publication fees but do little in terms of peer review. Tips and tools to identify legitimate open access journals and avoid predatory publishers will be covered.  Authors rights will also be covered.
