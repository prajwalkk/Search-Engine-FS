If you are looking for information on MS programs in civil and materials engineering, see below for details on requirements and options. In addition to providing knowledge and skills for jobs in industry, these two programs set the stage for an eventual doctoral degree, if you decide you wish to go on for further study.  If you are looking for information on the MS in construction engineering and management program, please visit its program page .       MS in Civil Engineering       Civil engineering is a broad-based discipline that encompasses many specialties in the areas of structural engineering and mechanics, environmental engineering, geotechnical engineering, and transportation engineering. Through the careful selection of courses, you can tailor the UIC MS in Civil Engineering program to meet your interests and needs.  Students pursuing the MS in Civil Engineering may choose between two options to complete their degree:  A thesis option , which provides the opportunity to gain research experience and is ideal for students who may be considering PhD study in the future. Thesis students often make connections in the field that can lead to career advice, research sponsorship, or other forms of funding.  A coursework-only option , intended for students who seek additional knowledge or who hope to obtain a professional license in the civil engineering field. This option is available for part-time as well as full-time students.  MS in Civil Engineering students also have the opportunity to focus their study in a specific area of concentration, which helps to target their master’s degree experience toward their desired outcomes. Our concentration choices include:          Construction engineering and management         1       Graduate studies in construction engineering and management mainly focus on best practices in Integrated Construction Project Management (IPM).  Students learn how to optimize construction projects in the face of multiple and varied constraints, such as budgets, schedules, risk, quality requirements, human resources, communication channels, procurement practices, and stakeholder management.  Students in this concentration explore the interdisciplinary connections that exist between construction engineering and other areas of society and economics. Examples include:   Construction financial planning  Cultural considerations in managing engineering project teams of diverse and multinational backgrounds  Engineering entrepreneurship  Health, safety, and sustainability initiatives  Game-theory applications in construction management  Litigation and construction claims  Managerial strategic planning  Organizational behavior             Environmental engineering         1a       The environmental engineering concentration at UIC is broadly conceived, extending beyond the traditional boundaries of the field.  This concentration covers topics such as:   Evaporation and other interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere  Geoscience aspects of waste disposal  Groundwater contamination and transport  Management of stored and spilled hazardous waste  Surface and groundwater hydrology and hydraulics  Other environmental science and water resources problems   Courses in this concentration draw on the expertise of faculty from several other UIC departments, such as biology, chemical engineering, chemistry, environmental and occupational health sciences, geology, mathematics, and mechanical and industrial engineering. The involvement of these faculty members in our program allows students to explore a wide range of topics in the water resources and environmental engineering field.            Geotechnical Engineering         2a       The geotechnical and geoenvironmental engineering area of concentration encompasses classical geotechnical engineering—analyzing and designing foundations, retaining structures, and underground structures—as well as environmental geotechnics, such as designing waste containment systems and performing remediation studies.  Students are able to work with faculty whose research addresses a variety of subjects in this area, including environmental geotechnics (e.g. the characterization, containment, remediation, and performance of contaminated materials), earthquake engineering, pavement analysis, and geomechanics.            Structural engineering and structural mechanics         2       MS students in the structural engineering and structural mechanics concentration learn static and dynamic analysis of linear and nonlinear structures including modal analysis, the behavior of structural materials, and the design of structural systems in concrete and steel.  Students examine both current and potential problems in structural engineering. Topics covered include, but are not limited to:   Bridge rehabilitation and rating  Concrete fracture, damage, and creep  Failure process of concrete structures  Linear and nonlinear finite element analysis  Microstructures of materials  Structural dynamics and seismic response of structures   This curriculum provides a strong foundation for advanced work in professional practice, research, and teaching. It lays the groundwork for careers in private consulting or construction firms, industrial and governmental research laboratories, and universities, among others.            Transportation engineering         3   The transportation engineering concentration is oriented toward methods for the planning, design, and operation of surface transportation systems.  Through their coursework and research, students work alongside faculty to learn about and develop solutions to problems related to surface transportation facilities (infrastructure) through the application of optimization and simulation methods, as well as knowledge-based systems. In recent years, the faculty has also engaged in the design and evaluation of intelligent transportation systems.             MS in Civil Engineering Curriculum   The curriculum requirements for the MS in Civil Engineering vary based on whether students select the thesis option or the coursework-only option .

Any course outside of the College of Engineering must receive prior approval from the academic advisor.             MS in Materials Engineering       Materials—including metals, intermetallics, polymers, ceramics, composites, and electronic materials—are critical to modern industrial society. Materials engineering is an expansive field that encompasses many specialties and offers rich opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration.  Materials engineering addresses the design, manufacture, and characterization of materials for specific applications. Materials development is an enabling step to the production of advanced engineering devices. Materials selection is a key element in the design, manufacturing, and quality control of structures and devices.  Because UIC and many other universities do not offer an undergraduate program in materials engineering, it is common for students with degrees in relevant subjects other than materials engineering to pursue this degree and enter the field. Our faculty help our graduate students in materials engineering to design an individualized academic program that makes use of the strengths in their background and gives them the knowledge and skills needed to move forward.  The MS in Materials Engineering is offered as a thesis option , a research-oriented degree that provides research experience and potential pathways toward research sponsorship or other funding, or a coursework-only option .
