During the summer session, international students can work 40 hours a week on CPT.  UIC Summer Session Registration  UPDATED: class registration will now begin on April 15th for UIC students. Check your Time Ticket to see your specific registration date and time for the summer session.       ois      International students must complete a Curricular Practical Training (CPT) application in order to obtain work authorization for off-campus internships. The Engineering Career Center can assist you with the CPT application process.  The Engineering Career Center DOES NOT process Optional Practical Training (OPT) applications for full-time employment. If you have obtained a full-time position, and need help with your OPT application, please visit with the Office of International Students (OIS) at UIC.

Career Tools               Completing Your CPT Paperwork (Must Complete All Steps)     Can the ECC Help Me Process My CPT Application?         cpt    All international students interning or conducting research off-campus must enroll in either ENGR 289 or 598 (Master’s research) or 599 (PhD research) course in their major.  Before meeting with the ECC, determine if you need to register for either ENGR 289, 598, or 599.  ENGR 289 – this course is used for students who are working in an internship in order to build their professional skills and knowledge.  Students must be actively taking Engineering courses at UIC in order to qualify to register for ENGR 289.    598 or 599 – these courses are used for students who want to work in an internship in order to conduct research for their thesis.  If you are NOT taking Engineering courses at UIC, then you should enroll in a 598 or 599 course to fulfill the requirements for your CPT application.    Once a thesis student has enrolled in 598 or 599, they can no longer enroll in ENGR 289 for the remainder of their time at UIC.  The ECC will complete page 4 (advisor form) of the CPT application for students who qualify for ENGR 289 ONLY.

Can I still apply for CPT?         Probation   Undergraduate and graduate students who are on academic probation may not apply for CPT during the academic year. Academic probation is a serious concern and puts students at risk for dismissal from UIC. Therefore, students applying for CPT during the Fall or Spring semesters will be denied – students should use their time during the academic year to focus on coursework and getting off of academic probation.  Undergraduate and graduate students who are on academic probation and obtain an internship over the summer months, may apply for CPT.  An undergraduate student is placed on academic probation at the end of any term in which the student earns less than a 2.00/4.00 grade point average. This rule applies even for the student with a cumulative GPA of 2.00/4.00 or higher. For more information on UIC’s probation and dismissal rules, please review the UIC course catalog .  A graduate student is placed on academic probation when their grade point average falls below a 3.00. For more information on UIC’s probation and dismissal rules for graduate students, please visit the UIC Graduate College .        What if I have more detailed questions regarding CPT or OPT?         cpt   Contact the Office of International Services (OIS) at UIC: 312-996-3121 or visit the OIS website for more information.

Schedule Your CPT Appointment       Testimonial        I did my Master’s in Industrial Engineering. After graduating I was searching for a job but it was difficult out there. I was not able to get the desired outcome as needed. I knew something was going wrong in my job search.  That’s when ECC came in. I took serious efforts in improving my resume, interview skills, etc., and the ECC helped me a lot. When I was a student I hardly visited them, but as an alum, I started visiting them regularly. They were very helpful. They helped me a lot by giving me job search tips, conducting mock interviews, and preparing me for opportunities. I started getting more and more interview calls, and finally I landed a job.  I would advise all the current students to start seeking help from the ECC from early on so that you are ready for the opportunity when it knocks your door. I would again like to THANK the ECC for helping me out. Thank you.
