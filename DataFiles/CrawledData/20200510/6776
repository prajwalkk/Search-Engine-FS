To request transcripts:  UIUC/UIS students will need to request an official UIC transcript in order to transfer your grades back to your home campus. Grades will not be transferred automatically.  You can order an official transcript for both the 4- and 8-week session classes after the 8-week session has ended (August 8). You can request a transcript online, in person, or in writing. There is a charge for each transcript. To order a transcript or see details on cost, delivery options and timing, go to Transcripts or call the Office of the Registrar at (312) 996-9575.  Please note that transcripts may not be available for up to two weeks after a term’s final exams have ended. Transcripts will not be released if there is a hold on your record (i.e. if tuition and fees have not been paid in full).           Have a question? Chat live with Summer Session Staff!
