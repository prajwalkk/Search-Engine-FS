Who is eligible for a Social Security Number?  How do I obtain a Social Security Number?  How should I handle my Social Security Number?  Do I need a Social Security Number to open a bank
    account?  Can I apply for an Illinois driver's license
    without a Social Security Number?    What is a Social Security Number?  Social Security Numbers (SSNs)
are used to report a person’s wages to the U.S. government and to determine a
person’s eligibility for Social Security and other government services. For
more information, see the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) publication, Social Security Numbers for Noncitizens .    Who is eligible for a Social Security Number?  SSA issues SSNs to people
lawfully admitted to the U.S. on a temporary basis who have authorization to work
by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In general, international
students and scholars must have an authorized, paying job to be eligible for an
SSN.   How do I obtain a Social Security Number?  In order to obtain an SSN you
must submit an application to a Social
Security Administration (SSA) office . The contents of your
application will depend on your specific immigration status, as described
below.  International students, scholars,
and employees working at UIC should consult with your department administrator
or Human Resources contact for additional guidance before starting this
process.  When should I go to the SSA
office ?  OIS strongly recommends that you
wait at minimum one business day from the date you arrive to the U.S. to apply
for your SSN. SSA must verify your immigration status in order to accept your
application and it takes one business day for federal databases to communicate
information about your arrival and status to SSA. Applying early may result in significant delay of receiving your SSN.  Where is the SSA office?  While you may visit any SSA office location , the
offices nearest UIC campuses are familiar with processing the applications of
UIC students, scholars, and staff.   SSA

        employer’s job offer letter.  H-1B, TN, or O-1 status – Form I-797.  Pending Permanent Residency – USCIS issued EAD.    What happens after I submit
my application ?  Once you apply, SSA will process
your application and, if approved, mail you a card containing your unique and
permanent Social Security Number (SSN). It can take 2-6 weeks from the date of
application for the card to arrive by mail. After you receive your card, please
submit a copy directly to your employer.  Most likely you will receive a
Social Security card that has the notation, “VALID FOR WORK ONLY WITH DHS AUTHORIZATION.”
SSA issues this type of card to people lawfully admitted to the United States
on a temporary basis who have authorization to work by the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS).   How should I handle my Social Security Number?  Your Social Security Number
(SSN) is sensitive, personal identification information. In general, you should
not carry your Social Security card in your wallet on a daily basis. It may
help to memorize your number and only carry the card when you know it will be
needed for a specific purpose. Common scenarios in which your SSN will be
requested are:  •  When an employer is
setting up payroll and tax paperwork at a new job.  •  When setting up a
new bank account, opening a credit card, or applying for a loan.  •  When a business
needs to check your credit in order to apply for an apartment, sign up for
utilities, or get a contract-based mobile phone plan.  However, since SSNs are commonly
used in identity theft scams, it’s a good idea to ask questions before deciding
to share your number in-person, on a form, or online. For example if someone
wants you to share your or your child’s SSN, you can ask:  •  Why do they need
your SSN?  •  How will your SSN be
used?  •  How will protect
your SSN and other personal information?  •  What happens if you
don’t share your SSN?  •  Is there other
identifying information you can provide in place of the SSN?  If you don’t feel comfortable
with the answers to these questions, or you are being asked to share your SSN
over public Wi-Fi to a non-encrypted website, it may be best to protect your
SSN and not share it.  Information adapted from the
Federal Trade Commission’s site, How to Keep
your Personal Information Secure .   Do I need a Social Security Number to open a bank account?  U.S. financial institutions are
required to verify the identity of every individual who opens a bank account.
In compliance with federal regulations, all banks operating in the U.S. have
established Customer Identification Programs (CIP) that they are to follow for
anyone who seeks to open an account. While the specifics of the CIP may vary
from one bank to another, Department of Treasury regulations found at 31 CFR §
103.121 set forth the following minimal information that the banks must obtain
from you before allowing you to open an account:   Your name  Your date of
    birth  Your street
    address – no P.O. Box  An
    identification number   The regulations 31 CFR §
103.121(b)(i)A)(4)(ii) clarify that for a non-U.S. person the identification
number shall be one or more of the following:   taxpayer
    identification number (ITIN)  passport
    number and country of issuance  alien
    identification card number  number and
    country of issuance of any other government-issued document evidencing
    nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or similar safeguard   It is important to remember that
banks establish their own customer identification programs and may ask for
additional documentation than is described above because they are ultimately
responsible for establishing the identity of their customers.   Can I apply for an Illinois Driver’s License without a
Social Security Number?  A Social Security Number is not
required to obtain a State of Illinois Driver’s License. Internationals (F-1,
F-2, J-1, J-2, among others) in Illinois may obtain a Temporary Visitor Driver’s
License (TVDL) from various locations in the state. To apply, you will need to
visit the Social Security Administration to request a letter stating that you
are not eligible for an SSN, this is known as a Form L-676. If, however, you
are eligible for a SSN, then you must apply for and receive the SSN before
applying for a state driver’s license.  For more information, visit the
