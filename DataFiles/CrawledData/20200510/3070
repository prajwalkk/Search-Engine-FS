Off-Campus   UIC has an Off-Campus Housing office located on the second floor of the Student Residence Commons, 700 S.   Halsted, Room 2026.  The office provides housing information and offers   many services that you may find helpful in making your living   arrangements. Many internationals choose to live off-campus. Chicago is   a big city with many diverse neighborhoods .  A word of advice : If finances are a concern, we recommend   that you do not rush into signing a housing contract (lease) until you   are aware of all your housing options. Calculate carefully what you can   realistically afford before making your decision. Be aware that   heating costs may not be included in your rent and may be a separate   expense. Due to the climate in Chicago, this can be expensive.
