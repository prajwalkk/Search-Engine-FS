Perhaps more than any other constituency on campus, they have tremendous influence on students’ learning and development of worldview. In addition to their interaction with students in the classroom where we encourage them to promote study abroad as an integrated part of the undergraduate curriculum, faculty also have the opportunity to work with SAO and plan, create, and teach on a study abroad program.  Faculty-led Program Development / Departmental Programs  Faculty are encouraged to meet with the Study Abroad Office to discuss their ideas for faculty-led programming and/or department supported third party programs. SAO can advise on all non-curricular parts of programs and lay out a timetable and process for contracting with a partner abroad as applicable, outreach and recruitment of students, administrative protocols, etc. Contact the Associate Director of Study Abroad, Irina Krymova , with any questions, or call (312) 413-7662.  The formal approval process begins when a faculty member creates the proposal, reviews with SAO staff for delivery viability, and then submits it to their department chair and the college for academic approval.  There are two models of faculty-led programs:   Stand alone short-term [4-6 week] summer programs ( Summer Proposal Template ).  Embedded programs as part of an on-campus course with the international component usually delivered during spring break ( Embedded Course Proposal Template ).   See the Faculty-led Program Handbook for specifics about the planning, outreach, and delivery of a program.  Once the department and college have signed off, the proposal comes back to SAO. Based on the approved proposal, SAO will collaborate with the faculty and the academic partner abroad to create a budget, schedule, and outreach materials for the program. To accommodate the time needed to complete Illinois state procurement requirements and contracting with the appropriate international partner, the deadline for submission of proposals for Summer and embedded Fall programs is April 30 th of the previous year. For embedded programs in a Spring term, the deadline for submission is January 31 st of the previous year.              © Copyright 2014-2020 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois      Footer Navigation                    Vice Provost for Global Engagement  Office of External Scholarships  Office of Financial Aid  University Registrar  Centers for Diversity  Disability Resources  Privacy Policy  Contact Us          Translate » co      Cookie Settings
