This project proposes various methods for static as well as runtime verification of such computer systems.  As part of the static verification, the project investigates model checking based methods for analysis and verification. It explores such methods for deterministic as well as probabilistic systems.  As part of the run time verification, project develops methods for detecting faults at execution time when the faults are specified on the underlying computations of the system in expressive languages such as temporal logic and automata. The developed methods are used for safe deployment and operation of Cyber Physical Systems such as Autonomous cars, Home assist robots, etc. The project employs Hidden Markov Models for capturing the behavior of such systems and develops accurate and timely monitors for detecting erroneous behavior in such systems.

Security  Our projects in security are broadly focussed in two directions. The first direction is on exploring model checking based techniques for analyzing access control policies and for verifying security properties of programs. The second direction is towards developing program transformation techniques for preventing leakage of confidential information.   DEICS: Data Erasure In Concurrent Software (with K. Gondi and V. N.
