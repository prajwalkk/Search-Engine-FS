To keep the system secure, the employee is required to authorize the third party to receive their information. This can be done via the Employment Verification System (EVS) . Active employees must use this approach for all employment verifications. Please read through the Frequently Asked Questions to understand how this process works for ACTIVE Employees.  If you need technical assistance with the on-line system, please contact the UIC HR Helpdesk at (312) 413-4848       Instructions for UIC Employees   Current UIC Employees  You will need to create a Vendor Access Number (VAN) for access by third-party, such as a mortgage company:   Go to the Employee Verification System .  Click the Access EVS button.  Log on with your NetID and password.  Follow the on-screen instructions to establish a Vendor Access Number (VAN).   Please Note: You will need to give the vendor your Social Security Number and the VAN you have just created.
