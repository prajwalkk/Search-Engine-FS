Gleeson Scholarship The Professor James P. Gleeson Scholarship Fund was created with a significant contribution from Jim Horan, MSW ’79, along with contributions from Jim and Linda Gleeson and other friends and colleagues. The fund honors Dr. Gleeson for his 30 years of dedication to JACSW, his students, and the larger community.          Carol S. Goldbaum Scholarship The Carol S. Goldbaum Scholarship Fund was established by alumnus Carol Goldbaum, PhD ’88, to support students interested in clinical social work who have lived in or wish to work in an impoverished inner city community.          Phillip M. Squibb Family Scholarship Phillip Squibb established this scholarship for students who have families. As a JACSW student, he quit his job to earn his Master of Social Work degree and funds for his family’s living expenses were tight, especially after they’d just had their second child. “The support I received relieved pressure at home so that I could focus on my education and experience,” he says, “so I wanted to pay it forward and help people who are in the same position I was in.”          Nancy A. Hanson Scholarship The Nancy A. Hanson Scholarship Fund was established by alumnus Nancy Hanson, MSW ’79, to support outstanding social work students who have financial need.          Sally Reuter Radka Memorial Scholarship The Sally Reuter Radka Memorial Scholarship Fund was established by Sally’s husband John in her honor and memory, for students returning to school after a hiatus. Sally began her college career at the age of 39, receiving her MSW in 1979 five years later.          Nancy J. Alexander Scholarship The Nancy J. Alexander Scholarship was established for students interested in working with aging populations.          Randy A. Fisher Scholarship Fund The Randy A. Fisher Scholarship was established for students in the School Social Work Specialization.
