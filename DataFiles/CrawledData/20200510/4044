Johnson Family Health Center is striving to safely meet our patients’ more urgent needs, including those of young children and pregnant or post-partum women, as we respond to COVID-19 in our community.

That’s why we want our patients to come to appointments alone, have your driver wait in the car, or limit a needed caregiver to one person if at all possible.
