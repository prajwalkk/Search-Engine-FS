It accomplishes this through offering students, faculty and staff a place to report instances of bias and discrimination on campus, and coordinates with other campus units to support and educate those involved.  The Diversity Education team takes a proactive approach to bias reduction, and offers trainings and resources to students, faculty and staff on topics such as bystander intervention and unconscious bias.       A Message from the Director   Hello Everyone,  My name is Jess Joslin (pronouns: she/her/hers) and I am the Director of UIC Dialogue Initiative and Diversity Education in the Office of the Dean of Students. I joined the Office in late January 2020 and am still learning all of UIC’s many acronyms. I wanted to introduce myself, tell you a bit about my role and the support that Diversity Education can provide you.  My role has two main parts. First, I work with and support UIC’s Dialogue Initiative , our campus’ intergroup dialogue program. In brief, intergroup dialogue is a social justice education program grounded in facilitated conversations and pedagogical tools designed to foster understanding across differences, and inspire collective action toward a more just and inclusive world. Right now, one of the best ways for students to interact with the Dialogue Initiative is through one of the many dialogue courses offered through the University Library.  I am happy to offer consultations and workshops on how intergroup dialogue techniques and pedagogies could support your organizational or departmental goals. If that is of interest to you please be in touch! Over the next few months, I will share descriptions of various intergroup dialogue tools here that may help spark your thinking about how we can work together.  The second part of my role is focused on reducing, preventing, and responding to incidents of bias on our campus, and collaborating with a range of units from across UIC toward that effort. A key part of this work is developing and managing bias response policies and resources for the UIC community. Over the next few months, students, faculty and staff will have access to a tool to report instances of bias they experience on campus and, if they wish, receive follow up from a member of the bias response team. If you are interested in being involved in the development of such a tool, or being a part of the bias response team, please let me know.  I am looking forward to getting to know you, and please don’t hesitate to introduce yourself and let me know how I can help you feel welcome and included at UIC.  Go Flames,  Jess Joslin  joslin@uic.edu  April 2020      Report Incidents  Bias Reporting Tool           COVID-19 Bias Reporting  Unfortunately COVID-19 has led to a rise in discrimination against Asian and Asian Americans and exposed many of the disparities that exist in our world. To address these concerns, we developed a bias reporting tool for members of our campus community — students, faculty, and staff — to share instances of bias and discrimination that they have experienced in the wake of COVID-19. We also collaborated with the Women’s Leadership and Resource Center , the Office of International Services , and the Asian American Resource and Cultural Center to develop a brief guide for identifying and reducing stigma related to the virus.   Report COVID-19 Bias Incidents         Frequently Asked Questions about the Bias Incident Reporting Tool     What is a bias incident?         Answer   For the purposes of this tool, a bias incident is any form of discrimination or harassment against a member of the University community because of real or perceived race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, order of protection status, genetic information, marital status, disability, sexual orientation including gender identity, and/or veteran status.        What happens after I submit a report?         Answer   An Office of the Dean of Students staff member will review your report and decide how to proceed. Reports will be maintained in our database, helping us to get a fuller picture of the challenges faced by our community. If the person reporting includes their contact information, staff from the Office of the Dean of Students will get back in touch with you to gather any additional information, offer support and resources, and discuss what follow up is desired.  Possible follow up includes, but is not limited to:   The Office of the Dean of Students may consult and coordinate with the Office of Access and Equity, the Office of the Vice Provost for Diversity and/or other University offices regarding bias complaints  Documenting instances  Offer support and connecting impacted parties to relevant University resources  A referral to the student conduct process  Coordination of spaces for community support and healing         I have an additional question that was not addressed here. Who should I direct my question to?         Answer   Please email Jessica Joslin, the Director of UIC Dialogue Initiative and Diversity Education, in the Office of the Dean of Students at joslin@uic.edu.
