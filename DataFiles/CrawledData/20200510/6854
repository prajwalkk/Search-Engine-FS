Our accomplished faculty are distinguished in their areas of expertise, have outstanding records of scholarly publications, and often consult with government agencies, NGOs and private corporations.  The UIC Department of Economics and the Programs for International Partnerships (PIP) office work together closely to offer a non-degree, two-semester undergraduate program, as well as Master of Arts in Applied Economics degree.         Non-Degree Training Program        This program provides an opportunity for undergraduate students in Economics, and related majors, at reputable, foreign universities the opportunity to enhance their studies by spending one year pursuing coursework at UIC.  Students in the program are sophomore (second year) or junior (third year) students who have finished one or two full years or prior undergraduate study in their home country. The program allows students to courses in a variety of subjects related to the field of Economics taught by UIC Faculty who are experts in their fields.  Additionally, students will take an English course offered by UIC’s Tutorium in Intensive English.  Please contact PIP to find more about contracted degree requirements, curriculum, and admission standards for the Economics non-degree program.          MA Program in Applied Economics        The MA in Applied Economics program at UIC is designed for students who desire an MA degree in economics as either a stepping stone to a Ph.D. program or a career that requires such preparation, but have not extensively studied economics in an undergraduate program. This program provides analytically rigorous training in economic theory and statistical analysis that is accessible to students with less preparation in mathematics than is required for enrollment in an Economics Ph.D. program  Please contact PIP to find more about contracted degree requirements, curriculum, and admission standards for the MA in Applied Economics program.
