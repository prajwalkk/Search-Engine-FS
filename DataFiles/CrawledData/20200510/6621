With 20 percent of U.S. students reporting food insecurity, and 13 percent reporting housing instability, it is important that we address these concerns on our campus. Please know that you are not alone.  Programs and resources to support UIC students experiencing homelessness and/or hunger are available, and it is a growing effort.
