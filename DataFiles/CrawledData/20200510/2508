Design practice in the 21st century encompasses a growing spectrum of activities that emerge from time-honored formal traditions, engage with rapidly-evolving material and digital revolutions, and extend to critical and creative leadership strategies. Through guided creation of objects and communications, and systems and services, UIC School of Design prepares future leaders for the expanding field of design.  Grounded in studio culture and deeply involved with the human experience, UIC Design programs are organized to reflect and to advance developments in the field. Led by a faculty of renown professional designers who are deeply committed to teaching, UIC Design students are introduced to contexts of culture and meaning as they develop the formal, conceptual, and technical skills necessary to confidently enter a professional setting. Advanced students are provided opportunities to work collaboratively in interdisciplinary teams, often engaging with partners in community or industry. We take great pride in the fact that many ideas inititated in UIC Design classrooms expand beyond the university to bring about positive change in the world.  Design happens in cities. Through engagement with the UIC Innovation Center and its industry partners, involvement in UIC Student Chapters of national design professional associations, employment in professional internships, and critical exposure to the world of design practices and exhibitions, students become active in the profession as they experience Chicago as a global design center.
