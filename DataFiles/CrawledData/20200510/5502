Content Creation & Maintenance   In order for content to be useful, usable, accessible and findable, we must deliberately plan for the full lifecycle of content and services and build in assessment at each step. This lifecycle and the workflows involved in each phase are outlined below. Content and services can range from small scale projects, such as the addition of a new section on a web page, to large scale content review and revision for an individual site.  Content Lifecycle  Needs identification   When a stakeholder requests a new site, service or piece of content, the first step is to identify a valid user need as outlined in the UIC Web Strategy and Standards Content Design Principles.  A stakeholder contacts the web property owner to request a new piece of content, or contacts UIC Digital Communications to request a new site.  The web property owner meets with the stakeholder to clearly identify use cases, user needs and a web property or content owner.  If no clear user needs or dedicated project stakeholders can be identified, the life cycle stops here.   Planning  The planning process can take anywhere from a few minutes for a small blurb on a web page, to a few months or years for a large scale web project.   The web property owner meets once or more with project stakeholders.  The web property owner and stakeholders establish goals, requirements, measures for success and stakeholder roles.  The project may be broken into multiple phases or iterations.  Stakeholders agree on clear steps for the content design and implementation process.  User experience design and assessment activities may be needed at this phase.   Content and service design   Content authors will design and edit new content or web services, based on the UIC Web Strategy and Standards, Web Style Guide and the results of any available assessment activities.  This process may happen concurrently with site development and visual design for medium and large scale projects.  Additional user experience design and assessment activities may be conducted and incorporated in this phase.   Implementation   The web property owner signs off on the initial iteration of the content or service for launch.  The designated implementation leads launch the new content or service.   Maintenance   Web property owners will conduct content reviews of all web properties at least once per year.  Ongoing usability testing and design activities will inform revisions of services and content.  If staffing changes, new content owners should be identified.  At least every three years, stakeholders should meet with site editors to review the site or content.   Retirement  If content does not meet content design principles or if there is no longer a primary stakeholder to manage it, it will be withdrawn.   The content review or a stakeholder identifies a service or piece of content that should be retired and contacts the specific website contact.  User experience design and assessment activities may be needed at this phase to confirm the need for retirement.   Content roles  Content authors  Content authors directly edit content on a web property. They are required to uphold the Content Strategy and Web Style Guide, and participate in regular content assessment. Content authors must also complete a minimum level of training in writing for the web and using the content management platform on which they create content.  Within a web property, content authors may have different levels of roles and permissions, and some authors may have additional editorial responsibilities to approve and publish the work of other authors. Content authors may also have different roles in different web properties.  Content author roles are set by the site owner.  Content owner  Every piece of content should have a content owner who is responsible for maintaining it through its full lifecycle. A web property owner assigns content ownership. If a department, committee or working group is the content owner, the chair or head will be ultimately responsible for the content.  Web property owner  Web property owners lead efforts to maintain and create all content on the site. They set content authoring permissions, assign ownership of content, and lead regular content review efforts. A site owner may be one person or the chairs of a working group or committee.       Writing Goals & Principles   Guiding principles for the UIC web presence are:      User Centeredness         Focusing on the User   User needs drive all of the content and services that make up the web presence. All web content and services are regularly assessed through user testing and use data. Areas of the web presence that do not meet the standards of our users are retired or improved.        Diversity         Inclusion   The web presence respects and builds upon the varied skills, backgrounds, and experiences of its diverse users through inclusive language and services. The tone of all web content should be friendly and easily understandable to a diverse audience.        Equity         Fairness to all   The web presence works to ensure equal access to information by providing services that meet or exceed standards for accessibility and usability.        Evidence-Based Practice         Researched Methods   The web presence operates on evidence-based best practices and original research with our users.        Innovation         Thinking outside the box   The web presence employs innovative new services and information practices that improve the online delivery of Library resources and services to our users.        Community Engagement         Public Relations   The web presence consists of services that engage with users and collaborators in the University, in Chicago, and with communities throughout the State, the Midwest region, and beyond.        Privacy         User Data Security   The web presence protects and upholds the University’s commitment to maintain the privacy of users of University websites.             Writing For The Web      Why is writing for the web different?   Online, users skim and scan. Reading is functional.  Users often read in places that make reading difficult, e.g. on electronic devices with tiny screens, or in stressful situations (searching for an address while standing on the street, reading with kids at home, etc.).  Content has to be user-focused. It must start and ends with users’ interests and questions in mind.   How to have a conversation with users  For each piece of content, ask:   Why? (What do you want to achieve?)  What do you want your site visitors to do?  Be specific about your purpose. “I’m writing this so that (who?) (can do what?)”    Who? (What’s the conversation?)  Anticipating the questions users ask helps us focus on what’s important to users, write content as conversation, and write with words site visitors use.     “Summary first” structure  Structure your content so that users can find the answers to their questions quickly. Summarize the essential information first, then reveal the information that supports it.  Other general guidelines   Write for your audience . What do your primary site visitors want and need to know? Use language the user will understand, not organizational or industry language unfamiliar to the user.  Be concise . Less is more.  Start with your key message . Don’t open with a summary or greeting.  Structure for scanning . Use bulleted lists and descriptive headings to break up walls of text. Not only do these add visible structure for readers, but they also aid in search results and accessibility for users with different abilities.        Voice & Tone   Our voice is our unique personality. Just as a person’s voice remains largely the same, so should the voice of our web presence. A well-crafted voice communicates our personality and values.  UIC’s voice is described in the UIC Style Guide under Lexicon .  Determine tone through context  Tone is more like attitude — the emotional context of a piece. Just as a person’s tone of voice changes to fit the somberness or lightness of a situation, so can the tone of writing used throughout our web presence.  What situation are users in?  To connect with people and show you care, you have to meet your users where they are. Think about the situation your readers are in. What did they come here for? Blog posts can be personal and casual, but if you’re writing a technical document to help someone troubleshoot, you probably need to take on an instructional tone. You can be a little more dramatic or persuasive in a marketing campaign than in your help center.  Above all, when you’re thinking about tone, consider the context of the message. For example, if you’re giving directions, you can naturally assume that readers need help finding their way.  How do users feel?  The next step is to think about your reader’s emotional state. Try to understand their frame of mind and talk to them where they are. Find out what happens just before your message appears. Is this good news that will make readers feel happy, relieved, or excited, or is it bad news that will make them frustrated, angry, or upset? Will the message brighten their day, or put them in a difficult situation? Are readers prepared, or will they be caught off guard? These questions will help you decide how to write the message.       Writing About People   View each accordion below for guidelines on how to describe people (from the MailChimp Content Style Guide .  Remember, words matter.  Additional information on the power of language is provided by the UIC Office of Diversity .      Age         Chronological References   Don’t reference a person’s age unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing. If it is relevant, include the person’s specific age, offset by commas:  The CEO, 16, just got her drivers license.  Don’t refer to people using age-related descriptors like “young,” “old,” or “elderly.”        Disability         Accommodating All People   Don’t refer to a person’s disability unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing. If you need to mention it, use language that emphasizes the person first: “she has a disability” rather than “she is disabled.”  When writing about a person with disabilities, don’t use the words “suffer,” “victim,” or “handicapped.” “Handicapped parking” is OK.        Gender & Sexuality         Gender Requirements   Don’t call groups of people “guys.” Don’t call women “girls.”  Avoid gendered terms in favor of neutral alternatives, like “server” instead of “waitress” and “businessperson” instead of “businessman.”  It’s OK to use “they” as a singular pronoun.  Use the following words as modifiers, but never as nouns:   lesbian  gay  bisexual  transgender  trans   When writing about a person, use their preferred pronouns. If you’re uncertain, just use their name.        LGBT, LGBTQ, LGBTQIA+         Acronym Explained   Acceptable in all references for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning and/or queer. In quotations and the formal names of organizations and events, other forms such as LGBTQIA(+) and other variations are also acceptable with the other letters explained. I generally stands for intersex, and A can stand for allies (a person who is not LGBT but who actively supports the LGBT community), asexual (a person who doesn’t experience sexual attraction) or both. The plus represents other identities that may fall under the umbrella.The word queer has been reclaimed by many LGBTQIA+ communities, but may be considered a slur in some contexts, so limit use of the word to quotes and names of organizations, following rules for obscenities, profanities, vulgarities as appropriate. Note that sex, gender and sexual orientation are not synonymous.        Hearing         Writing for Deaf People   Use “deaf” as an adjective to describe a person with significant hearing loss. You can also use “partially deaf” or “hard of hearing.”        Medical Conditions         Detailing an individual with a medical condition   Don’t refer to a person’s medical condition unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing.  If a reference to a person’s medical condition is warranted, use the same rules as writing about people with physical disabilities and emphasize the person first. Don’t call a person with a medical condition a “victim.”        Mental & Cognitive Conditions         Detailing Psychological definitions   Don’t refer to a person’s mental or cognitive condition unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing. Never assume that someone has a medical, mental, or cognitive condition.  Don’t describe a person as “mentally ill.” If a reference to a person’s mental or cognitive condition is warranted, use the same rules as writing about people with physical disabilities or medical conditions and emphasize the person first.        Vision         Writing for Blind people and those with low vision   Use the adjective “blind” to describe a person who is unable to see. Use “low vision” to describe a person with limited vision.             Web Elements   Alt text  Alt text is a way to label images, and it’s especially important for people who can’t see the images on our website. Alt text should describe the image in a brief sentence or two.  Buttons  Buttons should always contain actions. The language should be clear and concise. Capitalize every word, including articles. It’s OK to use an ampersand in button copy.  Standard website buttons include:   Log In  Sign Up Free  Subscribe  Email Us   Checkboxes  Use sentence case for checkboxes.  Drop-down menus  Use title case for menu names and sentence case for menu items.  Forms  Form titles should clearly and quickly explain the purpose of the form.  Use title case for form titles and sentence case for form fields.  Keep forms as short as possible.  Only request information that we need and intend to use. Don’t ask for information that could be considered private or personal, including gender. If you need to ask for gender, provide a field the user can fill in on their own, not a drop-down menu.  When writing microcopy on forms (i.e explanatory or instructional text that accompanies fields), be clear and concise. Microcopy should lend direction. Consider writing it an opportunity to further build a relationship with the user.  Headings and subheadings  Headings and subheadings organize content for readers. Be generous and descriptive.  Headings (H1) give people a taste of what they’re about to read. Use them for page and blog titles.  Subheadings (H2, H3, etc.) break articles into smaller, more specific sections. They give readers avenues into your content and make it more scannable.  Headings and subheadings should be organized in a hierarchy, with heading first, followed by subheadings in order. (An H2 will nestle under H1, an H2 under H3, and on down.)  Include the most relevant keywords in your headings and subheadings, and make sure you cover the main point of the content.  Use title case for titles (H1), unless the heading is a punctuated sentence. If the heading is a punctuated sentence, use sentence case.  Use sentence case (H2, H3, etc.) for subheadings regardless of end punctuation.  Links  Provide a link whenever you’re referring to something on an external website. Use links to point users to relevant content and trusted external resources.  Don’t include preceding articles (a, an, the, our) when you link text. For example:  Yes: Read the automation guide for details.  No: Read the automation guide for details.  If a link comes at the end of a sentence or before a comma, don’t link the punctuation mark.  Don’t say things like “Click here!” or “Click for more information” or “Read this.” Write the sentence as you normally would, and link relevant keywords.  Links should look different than regular copy, strong text, or emphasis text. They should have a hover state that communicates they’re interactive, and should have a distinct active and visited state.  Numbered & Bulleted Lists  Use lists to present steps, groups, or sets of information. Give context for the list with a brief introduction. Number lists when the order is important, like when you’re describing steps of a process. Don’t use numbers when the list’s order doesn’t matter.  If one of the list items is a complete sentence, use proper punctuation and capitalization on all of the items. If list items are not complete sentences, don’t use punctuation, but do capitalize the first word of each item.  Navigation  Your main or global navigation is used to guide site visitors around your website. It should contain ONLY internal links to your site pages. External links to other websites, including other UIC sites, can appear in eyebrow or footer menus, but not your main/global navigation menu.  Use title case for main or global navigation. Use sentence case for subnavigation.  Navigation links should be clear and concise.  Radio Buttons  Use title case for headings and sentence case for button fields.  Related articles  Linked articles should appear in a logical order, following the step down/step up rule: The first article should be a step down in complexity from the current article. The second one should be a step up in complexity to a more advanced article.  Titles  Titles organize pages and guide readers. A title appears at the beginning of a page or section and briefly describes the content that follows.  Titles are (you guessed it) in title case.  Don’t use punctuation in a title unless the title is a question.       UIC Specific Terms   Use these terms with caution. Be specific on first reference so that users know meaning when abbreviations or terms are used in subsequent text.   ACCC: This is the acronym for the Academic Computing and Communications Center.  athletics designation: UIC’s teams play in Division I-AAA of the NCAA. The conference is called the Horizon League. Note that the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, a member of the Big Ten Conference, has an athletics program entirely separate from UIC’s.  C: The letter C in UIC is not to be used as the first letter of a subsequent word that begins with the letter C, e.g., UICampus. Also, always insert a space between UIC and the subsequent word.  campus regions: lowercase. When writing about sides of campus, use the words the and of campus: the south side of campus, the east side of campus, the west side of campus. Avoid using east campus and west campus, which could imply distinctly separate campuses.  Great Cities Institute: Serves as UIC’s central point for new initiatives in interdisciplinary, applied urban research. It is structured as a research unit within the College of Urban Planning and Public Administration. Find it online at greatcities.uic.edu .  Horizon League: This is the NCAA conference of which UIC is a member.  i-card: The official University of Illinois Identification Card; always lower case, even at the beginning of a sentence.  Jane Addams Hull-House Museum: Note there are two d’s in Addams. Hyphenate Hull-House.  mail code: Two words. Abbreviate as MC (capital letters, no periods or slash) and leave a space between the acronym and the number. Place the abbreviation and the number in parentheses after the department name: Office of Public Affairs (MC 288). Official business cards demonstrate the correct format.  neighborhoods near UIC: Use these spellings for the most commonly identified neighborhoods surrounding UIC: Little Italy, Greektown, Pilsen, the Loop, Little Village, Chinatown, Near West Side.  netID: Use the lowercase “netID” when used in a sentence; use “NetID” at the beginning of a sentence or when used in title case.  phone numbers at UIC: Be mindful that, because there are multiple prefixes at UIC, five-digit extensions will be inadequate for anyone calling from a non-campus phone. Always include the full prefix when writing a phone number. Also, when writing a phone number in a document for external audiences, preface it with the area code, in parentheses. Example: (312) xxx-xxxx  residence hall: This is the term used at UIC, rather than dorm or dormitory.  Sparky D. Dragon: This is the official mascot of UIC athletics. In writing for external audiences, refer to the character by its full name or as Sparky, but specify that it is a mascot: Mascot Sparky D. Dragon will be on hand to welcome new students.  streets around UIC: Be mindful that roadways around UIC take a variety of suffixes: Roosevelt Road, Ashland Avenue, Halsted Street, Congress Parkway. If you do not know a street’s official suffix, check the U.S. Postal Services website; entering only the street name, with city and state, will deliver the appropriate suffix. Use of the abbreviations St., Ave. and Blvd. are acceptable in numbered addresses; all other suffixes should be spelled out in all uses.  UIC Flames: Capitalize in all references to the nickname for UIC athletic teams. Use with the university acronym on first reference. It can stand alone on subsequent references: The UIC Flames have won their first 11 games this season. Fans of the Flames are hoping to see their team go to the NCAA tournament.  UIC Student Center East: Formerly the Chicago Circle Center or CCC. Use of the former name should be discontinued.  UIC Student Center West: Formerly the Chicago Illini Union or CIU. Use of the former name should be discontinued.  University Library: The formal collective name for the UIC libraries  web page: Use for a single page of a website.  website: Use for the collection of pages from a single website.  University of Illinois System: This is the name of Illinois’ largest public university system, which comprises three universities in Chicago, Urbana-Champaign and Springfield. Effective with the approval of the 2016 Strategic Framework, this is the proper way to identify the entire organization. Acceptable second references are: U of I System, System, or University of Illinois on second reference. See System.  UIC Alumni Association: The UIC Alumni Association brings together a strong alumni network in support of UIC’s mission and goals. This organization encourages alumni to stay connected with UIC, and to each other, through events, awards and traditions, campus activities, and volunteer opportunities. Learn more online at http://advance.uic.edu/alumni-association  University of Illinois at Chicago: Not University of Illinois-Chicago. Use the full name rather than the acronym on first reference. Do not put UIC in parentheses after first mention of the full name. The acronym will be understood, and is acceptable to use, in subsequent references.  University of Illinois Board of Trustees: Capitalize all principal words. In subsequent references, use the board (lowercase).  University of Illinois Foundation: Spell out the full name on first reference. It is acceptable to use the foundation (lowercase) in subsequent references. Find the foundation online at www.uif.uillinois.edu. The corresponding department at UIC is the Office of Development.
