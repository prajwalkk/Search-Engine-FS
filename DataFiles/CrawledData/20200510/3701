Directive from the Dean : “You can teach either synchronously or asynchronously. If you are teaching asynchronously please make yourself available to students during the regularly scheduled time. If you are delivering your lectures at the regularly scheduled class time it will also be helpful for the students if they can get the lectures asynchronously (i.e., at other times in the day). Some of our students have returned home to other parts of the world and requiring them to watch a lecture at 3am in the morning is difficult. Also some students might experience localized technical difficulties, or we may even experience at times some widescale interruptions. These sorts of issues can be greatly alleviated if we are offering asynchronous content delivery.”       Teach Online   Recommended for teaching online and office hours.

If you are using a mobile device or screen reader, you can share files and a blank whiteboard with your attendees.   Frequently Asked Questions   Should I schedule a Session or use the Course Room ? You can do either one. Just remember to inform your students/participants where to go.  Using Course Room is just like showing up to class. You simply Join the room and you are online. Just remember to show up on time! Scheduling a Session has some advantages. For example, you can have a session even without you.  Students can join and start presenting right away and the session can be automatically recorded.  How long does it take for a Blackboard Collaborate recording to publish? It can take up to a few hours for recordings to show up.

For tips on online testing and assessment alternatives, see this short Remote Assessments and Examinations tutorial .

Create a topic/agenda, set password, set recurrence, allow another to host, and more.  Why schedule a meeting and not just start one? When you simply start a meeting it’s like sitting in your office with the door open vs. closed. Door open scenario: Someone can show up and either walk in or wait outside until called. Room Lock feature explains it in detail. Door closed scenario: someone can show up and knock. You can let them in or ignore them. If you enable Automatic Lock , you will see them waiting in the Lobby and can choose if/when to let them into your room.

Use a microphone headset or any microphone/headphone combination you already have, including AirPods. Laptop audio often has their mic close to the speakers, creating a loop that will create breaks in sound for the listener of your lecture. Another way to fix when you lecture is to lower your speaker volume, be in a quiet room, and stay close to the laptop mic.  Dial In Numbers are a great way to bypass computer audio issues. However, with increased demand, some services are reporting issues. Check status links on https://bioe.uic.edu/teaching-online/ to view latest service disruption reports.  Turn off video camera : Only time you should use a camera is to say Hi! The rest of the time should be audio and screen share.  Mute everyone else when you are lecturing.  People’s mics will pick up background noises and create breaks in your lecture.  Share your screen : Don’t forget to share your entire screen instead of individual applications. It is easier to swap between windows when you teach with multiple media.

Anything odd then let us know 😉.  Email spoofing – all too familiar for the past couple years, spoofing emails ‘look’ like they are coming from people you know, but they are attacks in hopes that you reply. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do to prevent such attacks. Information about our faculty is publicly available on websites and can easily be used to write a convincing email. Anyone can go to legitimate email services (gmail, yahoo, aol…) and create an address that looks almost like the real person’s email. Such emails will keep coming, but here are a few tips to spot a spoof when the email just seems odd:   Don’t reply!  Check for inconsistencies such as the email address, the signature, and context.  Always look at the actual email address, not the displayed name, to confirm who sent the email. This can be difficult with email clients on Smartwatch screens, phone notifications, or even computer email software (displays just the name, not the actual email address).  Be careful when drafting a fresh email to the real person. If you replied to the spoofed email, your email software might grab the spoofed address and save it to your address book. Be sure to delete it.   Additional recommended ACCC links for online safety:    ACCC Security Awareness site: Search for answers    Can you spot the phish?    I signed into a fake UIC website!
