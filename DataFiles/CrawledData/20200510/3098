It explains the process to apply for work  authorization and also lists other relevant information pertaining to  the maintenance of J-2 immigration status.    Conditions  How to Apply  Authorization to Work  Sample Letter of Application for J-2 Work Permission  Other J-2 Information      Conditions    You must hold valid J-2 status, and the Exchange Visitor must hold valid J-1 status, as shown on your I-94 Arrival/Departure Record cards or electronic printout .  Your income may not be used to support your J-1 spouse or parent.  You may begin work for the period authorized after you receive your  Employment Authorization Document (EAD) from the U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services (USCIS). The EAD is an identification card  laminated in plastic, with your photograph, signature, and the  expiration date of your permission to work.  You may work part-time or full-time, at any job, for any employer. There is no salary limit. You may also work without a salary, as long  as you possess a valid EAD card.  USCIS can authorize J-2 employment through the end date of the Form DS-2019.     How to Apply   Apply by mail at least 90 days in advance of the desired work start date.  Assemble the documents  in the following order:  Check or money order payable to the “Department of Homeland Security”  Completed Form I-765, “Application for Employment Authorization,” available at the USCIS website   Question number 16: J-2s should use the code “(c) (5).”  Address: It is very important that you use a mailing address that  will be current 90 days into the future when you file your application  for J-2 work permission. Correspondence from the USCIS cannot be  forwarded.    Letter to request work permission (see sample below)  Photocopy of I-94 of J-1 (front and back, even if there is nothing written on the back) or electronic print out .  Photocopy of I-94 of J-2  (front and back even if there is nothing written on the back) or electronic print out .  Photocopy of J-1’s DS-2019 SEVIS DS-2019  Photocopy of your J-2 dependent SEVIS DS-2019  Photocopy of any previous EADs (clear, clean, legible copies)  Photocopy of J-2’s passport pages (picture and information pages,  visa page, clear, clean, legible copies–if you are Canadian you may use  another form of photo-bearing identification).  Two identical color photographs with a white background taken no earlier than 30 days before submission to USCIS. Lightly print your I-94 # and name on the back of each photo with a pencil. (See Form I-765 Instructions for complete photograph details.)  Copy of marriage certificate and appropriate translation if neccessary.    Mail the documents to the appropriate USCIS location (see Form I-765 directions, p. 10).  There is no specific address for code (c) (5); therefore, you will  send the form to Phoenix or Dallas, depending on the home address used.  We strongly suggest that you send the application by certified mail  or overnight express. (USPS “Express Mail” will be delivered to the  standard USPS address listed on p. 10, not to the “courier” address.)  Keep copies of the entire application    Optional, though strongly recommend: Complete Form G-1145,  “E-Notification of Application/Petition Acceptance” if you would like to  receive an email and/or text message notification that USCIS has  accepted your application. This should be stapled to the top of your  Form I-765.     Authorization to Work   If your immigration status ends, so does  your work permission. J-2 status is dependent on that of the J-1. If  the J-1 is eligible for an extension of status, he/she should seek the  consultation of his/her international adviser/Responsible Officer. A  pending application at USCIS for a new EAD does not authorize you to  continue working (check with your employer for additional information). When you receive your new EAD, you should update the Work Eligibility  Form (Form I-9) with your employer.  Sample Letter of Application for J-2 Work Permission   USCIS requires a letter from you, the J-2  dependent, requesting work permission. The purpose of the letter is to  explain to USCIS that the primary J-1 Exchange Visitor has sufficient  resources for his or her own expenses, and will not depend on your  earnings. In the letter you should indicate the sources and amount of  the J-1 Exchange Visitor’s support. You should give a reason for  wanting to work, some worthwhile interest or activity that might include  family travel or recreational or cultural activities. In your letter you should explicitly state that income from your earnings will not be used to support the J-1 Exchange Visitor.       [Your street address] [Your city, state, and zip code] [Date]    U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services [Street address] [City, state, zip code]      Dear Immigration Officer:  I would like to apply for J-2 work permission.   My [husband’s or wife’s] Form DS-2019 shows $20,000                 in support, including $15,000 from [name] University, and $5,000                 in personal funds.  I understand that none of my earnings may be used for the support                of my J-1 spouse.  Sincerely, [Your signature] [Your name]         Other J-2 Information   Taxes : The earnings of J-2 dependents are subject to  applicable federal, state and local taxes, as well as Social Security  deductions. Employers are required by law to withhold those taxes from  paychecks. You must file an income tax return, Form 1040NR, by April 15 th each year, with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxes due the  prior calendar year. The Return determines whether you owe additional  taxes or if you will receive a refund. You must also file a “Required  Statement” with Form 1040NR; see IRS Publication 519, “U.S. Tax Guide  for Aliens.” You may also want to review information on the “International Taxpayer” section of the IRS website.  Study : J-2 dependents are eligible for  degree-seeking study in the U.S. as long as the    primary J-1 visa  holder is maintaining his/her status. J-2s will not be eligible for on-campus employment unless they possess an EAD card.  Extension of J-2 status : J-2 dependents are covered by the extension of stay granted to the J-1 visa    holder.  U.S. Social Security Number : J-2 dependents may apply for an U.S. Social Security Number only with a valid    EAD Card, DS-2019, and passport.  Driver Licenses : Please see the “Drivers License” section under “Life In Chicago” on our website for further information.    xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
