The Post-MSW Professional Educator License (PEL), School Social Worker Endorsement Program is a non-degree program that prepares individuals who have already obtained an MSW to become licensed school social workers. The curriculum prepares them for eligibility to obtain a PEL with a School Social Worker Endorsement, which is required to practice as a school social worker in the state of Illinois.  The program comprises a field education component spanning a full school year, and two additional courses typically taken during the fall semester of enrollment. The field education component (SOCW 574 and SOCW 575) involves an ISBE required school-based internship of at least 400 hours to be achieved over the academic year of the program through a minimum of two days per week in the setting. Both of the additional courses taken in the fall semester (SOCW 480 and SPED 410) are offered online.       Apply to the PEL Program      In the Words of Our Students    I’m so glad that I went out on a limb and went to your Post-MSW PEL session last January!  It was an intense semester, but so worth it!       Quote 2    I feel that I have grown both professionally and personally and been able to accomplish much more than I imagined I could in one semester.       Quote 3    I have had many moments with students where just being someone to listen and talk with them has seemed to make a big impact on their day. This is how I know I am glad that I pursued this program.
