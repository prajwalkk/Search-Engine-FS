The demands from your educational workload, along with day-to-day responsibilities, can be the source of stress.  Stress is the response to an event or situation that calls for change, threatens the order or safety of life, or places an unusual demand on your physical, mental, and emotional resources.  You can request an individual consultation with a Wellness Center Health Educator if you are experiencing stress and need a new way to help manage its impact on your life.
