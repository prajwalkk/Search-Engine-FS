We are hoping to elevate the voices of those who have been impacted by discrimination and Xenophobia.  We are asking for UIC students, faculty, and staff to submit brief video recordings of themselves responding to one or several of the questions below. Please keep your submission recording under 5 minutes long. We will compile the video submissions into a short video that we will share on the UIC Counseling Center Website.  Please submit using your UIC email address by April 30, 2020 to Dr. Nikki Falk, Post-Doctoral Fellow, UIC Counseling Center at falk5@uic.edu.  We will send a draft of the final video for your feedback within 48 hours before publishing it online.  When recording your responses, please share if you are a student, faculty, or staff and start by repeating the question you are responding to.  Please use the following questions to guide your submission: 1. How is discrimination and prejudice related to COVID-19 impacting you and your community? 2. How are you responding to witnessing or experiencing racial injustices or microaggressions? 3. What is society doing to respond to racial injustices or microaggressions?
