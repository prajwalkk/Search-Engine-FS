It provides university building and parking information, assists with directions, outlines UIC shuttle routes and provides high-resolution, print-optimized campus maps in PDF format available for download.  The map was developed by the Office of Capital Planning and Project Management and UIC graduate students in collaboration with Academic Computing and Communications Center, Office of Public and Government Affairs and other campus units using Google Maps Application Programming Interface (API) with a custom designed map overlay. Feedback may be provided using the âFeedbackâ link found on the bottom of the map.      PROVIDE FEEDBACK  X    We value your comments on how we can improve the interactive campus map.
