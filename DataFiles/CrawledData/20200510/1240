An important function of REACH is to allow the ACCC to keep in better contact with departmental needs. If your computing needs are changing, or if you find yourself seeking new options, the REACH members will let us know that our support focus must change, also. All members have agreed to share their knowledge with their colleagues, or if they don't know an answer, to at least point people to the appropriate ACCC support service.  A member might be faculty, staff, or student; they might be employed for computer support, but they could also be a volunteer.

Most departments have one member although a few active departments have two. If your department doesn’t have a REACH member, your department head can appoint one, directly on the web. We ask that each member be nominated by the department head, both to keep the size of REACH manageable, and to make sure the REACH member has implicit approval to spend time on REACH duties:  REACH
