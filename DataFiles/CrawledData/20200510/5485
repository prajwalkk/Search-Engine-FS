If they occurred, what impacts would they have on the community?  Based on these impacts, what capabilities should the community have in place?   The THIRA will provide a documented qualitative and quantitative report of the risks, and determine the level of capability needed to address those risks. Records display how that capability has changed over time including capabilities lost, sustained, and built, while also identifying capability gaps related to Planning, Organization, Equipment, Training, and Exercises. Using targets from the THIRA, it’s possible to establish intended approaches for addressing gaps and sustainment requirements. The outputs from this process lay the foundation for the HMP.
