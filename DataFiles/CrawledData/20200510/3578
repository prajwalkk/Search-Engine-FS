Please Note : Upon approval of our revised curriculum proposal later this academic year, the MS in Biomedical Visualization program will begin classes for newly admitted students on 6/15/2020, instead of 8/24/2020, as previously scheduled.  Before you start, check out our admission criteria on the Before You Apply page to make sure you meet all the requirements.  We consider all applications, but we strongly prefer that applicants have completed all prerequisite courses when applying. You should consider that admissions are very competitive—you’ll be competing with applicants who have satisfied all requirements at the time of application.      Deadline   All completed application materials and portfolio are due January 15 .      Checklist    Completed application  Unofficial transcripts  GRE scores  Personal statement  Three letters of recommendation  Art portfolio    Official UIC Application  Submit your application online via the UIC Website —just follow the instructions listed there. There is a non-refundable application fee of $70 for all applicants.  You don’t have to enter and submit all application information in one sitting. You can return to the system as many times as you need to. You can also return to the system checklist as often as you like to see what materials have been uploaded and verified as received.   Transcripts  Submit unofficial copies of registrar-issued official transcripts from institutions where you earned degrees and transcripts from all colleges and universities you attended within the last eight years.   GRE  GRE scores are required for all applicants. Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores should be sent directly from Education Testing Service to UIC. If you have taken the GRE within the past five years, you must request that scores be sent from ETS to UIC. Our ETS Institutional Code is 1851. Preference will be given to applicants with a combined Quantitative and Verbal score above 300 (revised General Test).   Personal Statement  Upload a personal statement with your application. This should be concise (1-2 pages) and clearly state your goals for graduate study and a career in our field. It can include anything else you’d like to include, such as what’s special, distinctive or impressive about you and your life story. What unique skills might you possess that would allow you to succeed in our profession?   Letters of recommendation  Submit three letters of recommendation in support of your application. These letters should be from instructors or employers. Letters must be on letterhead, signed, and uploaded with your application.

The arrangement of the shapes and the composition is your choice.  1 still life drawing or painting in color that includes both organic and geometric forms. Should demonstrate good form, volume, texture, and convincing spatial relationships.   The additional 10 images may include:   General drawing (pages from sketchbooks are encouraged)  Figure drawing  Color media  Digital media  Graphic design   There are no format specifications for the art portfolio, but we suggest preparing a PowerPoint or Keynote presentation. Digital images of your art portfolio in this presentation should be prepared in the range of 10×7.5 or 10×5.6 at 150 dpi.

Check out the International Requirements to see if this applies to you.  Scores must be submitted to UIC directly using the institutional code 1851.
