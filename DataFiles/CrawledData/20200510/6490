In celebration of that fact, we’re highlighting some of this year’s outstanding students and where they will do their residencies or fellowships.  Magdalena Mastalerz is from Chicago and is doing a 2-year pharmacy residency program in Health-System Pharmacy Administration and Leadership in acute care at the University Of Kentucky Healthcare in Lexington, KY. She will also be completing a Master of Business Administration degree at the University of Kentucky.  What drew you to pursue this specific area of pharmacy?  I always had a passion for clinical pharmacy. However, later in my pharmacy school career, I became inspired by my manager and mentor who is a female leader in pharmacy. She was able to gather insight from her clinical experiences throughout her career and use them to make larger-scale decisions that impacted a significant number of patients in her administrative roles. I too want to build my way into pharmacy leadership and be able to impact my patients in this way.  What is your long-term goal in pharmacy?  Ultimately, I envision myself in a pharmacy leadership role within a health-system that will enable me to develop high-quality drug information materials to empower a large number of patients to take control of their health.
