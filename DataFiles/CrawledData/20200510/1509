We especially recommend this minor for chemistry majors in the College of Liberal Arts who are interested in demonstrating to future employers that they possess an understanding of the ways in which chemistry is applied in engineering.  The chemical engineering minor requires between 16 and 18 semester hours, independent of any prerequisite courses. Many of the prerequisites are courses that UIC science and engineering majors already will have taken as part of their general education requirements, such as math, physics, and chemistry courses.  Follow the link below for the course catalog page on the ChemE minor. If you are thinking about pursuing a minor, contact your academic advisor to ensure that you meet the requirements and to coordinate these courses in your schedule.
