About  Like to play video games? Ever think about making them? Then SIG Game is the group for you! SIG Game is dedicated to exploring all facets of game development, and to that end provides an environment that parallels a real-world video game industry development environment. Members plan the game from design to implementation, collaborating with each other and critiquing each others' code in a source-controlled environment. SIG Game is welcome to anyone who enjoys the process of creating games, video or not. We will mostly cover the 3D game engine Unity since that is one of the most popular engines out there, and is being used by many prominent developers.  You can download Unity (Free version) here .  And here is a list of some popular games made in Unity.

"A game jam is a gathering of game developers for the purpose of planning, designing, and creating one or more games within a short span of time, usually ranging between 24 to 48 hours. Game developers are generally made up of programmers, game designers, artists, and others in game development-related fields."     (90% of these games were built off of prototypes made in game jams ( TIG ))  Here is a game jam tracker.    If you want to play awesome, obscure indie games I highly recommend this site.
