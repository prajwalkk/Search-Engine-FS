The Mission of IPE at UIC is to create transformational change in health professions education and health care service delivery by delivering evidence-based learning experiences that build collaborative competence and foster interprofessional scholarship and collaborative practice across academic programs, clinical services and community partners with focused attention to the pressing needs of underserved individuals and populations.  UIC continues to roll out a comprehensive and innovative IPE program for students in our 7 health sciences colleges and for the practicing health care professionals at the University of Illinois Hospital and Health Science System (UI Health).
