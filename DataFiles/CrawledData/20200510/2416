So as you may or may not know, Ludum Dare, a game jam/competition where you're tasked to create a video game in 48 hours, is coming soon. The next one will be from April 17th to April 19th. Just like last year, this year we're going to host Ludum Dare right here at UIC. It will take place in the CS lounge/ACM area, and will approximately last for 48 hours. Keith and I (Sunil) will be hosting it, so please try to come if you're interested. Here is some more information from the Facebook event created by Keith ( https://www.facebook.com/events/1560342244246179/ ): ----------------------------------------------------------------- It's that time of the year again: Ludum Dare. LD is a Game Development jam and competition What: Ludum Dare is a Game Development "jam" and competition. It is an online event but since it's lonely working alone and difficult to find others to work with, we created this event so everybody can get together and make teams to create something cool! When: Starts at 8 PM on Friday the 17th and goes until Sunday night, although the website allows you to submit up until 8 PM on Monday. Please try to arrive at 7:30 PM so we can get things organized and form teams (optional). Who can come: Anybody! Even if you've never made a game, anybody can contribute. There are some really simple game engines out there like GameMaker or Scratch which make it possible for anybody to design games. What you'll need: Bring any tools you need for your craft; laptops for programmers, instruments for musicians, drawing tablets for artists, etc. Teams: At 7:45 PM we will get everybody together and vote on two ways to make teams: A) Form your own, walk around and find programmers if you're an artist and vice versa. B) Tell us what your skills are and we will form balanced teams. Reduces the whole awkward human interaction thing.

The meeting agenda will consist of an introduction for new members to the SIG and the workspace in SELE 2264, a hardware demonstration, and collecting feedback for future workshops and presentations. We will also be touching base with continuing members, what they have been working on, and what progress still needs to be made. Anyone interested in attending is encouraged to look over the SIGs page on the ACM website as well as the information currently documented on the ACM wiki.  https://acm.cs.uic.edu/sigsysadmin https://acm.cs.uic.edu/wiki  Good luck with your semester, Walter Dworak ACM SysAdmin  Read more about SIG Sysadmin First Meeting Log in to post comments        Weekend Server Downtime     Submitted by walter on Thu, 11/13/2014 - 12:55     This Saturday some major building work is being done in SELE that will knock out power to the north side of the building. While this shouldn't interfere with the CS spaces, as a precaution there will be an equipment power down Friday night in expectation of a possible power outage in the entire building. There will be a placeholder site up with a notice about the building maintenance, but please grab any data you may need beforehand.  -Walter Dworak ACM SysAdmin  The following domains will be affected and potentially down until Monday: acm.cs.uic.edu lug.cs.uic.edu wics.cs.uic.edu dvorak.cs.uic.edu hans.cs.uic.edu brink.cs.uic.edu cuda.cs.uic.edu linux.cs.uic.edu malware.cs.uic.edu sigbuild.cs.uic.edu siggame.cs.uic.edu swe.cs.uic.edu acm.eecs.uic.edu  Read more about Weekend Server Downtime Log in to post comments        SIG SysAdmin Meeting Nov 10th 5PM     Submitted by walter on Mon, 11/10/2014 - 14:16     There will be a SIG SysAdmin meeting today despite what the calendar has been indicating. (The event should be listed again). The meeting will be at 5PM in the IT lab. The agenda will be assigning specific admin roles, any outstanding project setup, and project progress. If you have started a project, please make sure to attend this meeting so progress can be checked all at once.

I thought I'd take a moment to talk about one of our SIGs. As time goes on, I'll talk to more of our sigs and let you know what they're up to, but seeing as how SIG App met today, we'll start with them.  SIG App has been doing a lot with JS development and has some exciting meetings coming up. So far they've worked with basic JS and a few of the core libraries, useful for front end, back end, and database access development. Today particularly they went over using JS libraries to access Mongo DB (a popular database system). Jeff Gensler (head of SIG App) is doing a lot to help people become webapp developers. Next week, those who have been attending thus far will be giving presentations on libraries they haven't discussed yet. For those of you who are unaware, libraries are add-ons to the language in order to provide functionality not included in the standard release. If you're looking for a single SIG App meeting to go to, this would be a great one! We look forward to what they're doing, and with any grace, the apps they develop by the end of the semester.  SIG App meets Wendnesday at 4:00 PM and is headed by Jeff Gensler.

Today will be the guided Arch Linux installation in a VM. You will need access to a machine with SSH and internet access.  -Walter  Read more about SIG SysAdmin Meeting 9/29/2014 Log in to post comments        SIG SysAdmin Meeting 9/22/2014     Submitted by walter on Mon, 09/22/2014 - 08:46     Meeting reminder that there will be a SIG meeting today at 5:30pm and we will initially be meeting at SEL 2264. We will be doing the guided installation session today so anyone that has not yet gotten their ACM accounts setup will either need to beforehand or message me directly. I will be working around people not having an account for this meeting only, since it will be the first one that requires it.

Considering this, and the short notice before the first meeting, I would like anyone still interested in joining the SIG to go the the UIC Linux Users Group meeting tomorrow, 9/18/2014, at 5:30PM. The current room listing is for SEO 1000, but check the event details on their website, lug.cs.uic.edu, or the calendar event directly, http://goo.gl/apR51G , in case they make any last minute changes.  Also, if you cannot make it and would still wish to join and take part in the guided Linux installation that is planned, please send me an email directly at wdwora2 AT uic DOT edu or join our SIGs mailing list, details here: https://acm.cs.uic.edu/sigsysadmin , and post there.

However, due to the Reflections Projections Information meeting being held on Monday causing too much overlap for my comfort, this should NOT be regarded as the case. I will post a new update when I have more information as to the schedule, hopefully I can figure out an alternative meeting day for next week rather than push it back. Sorry guys, Walter Dworak  Read more about SIG SysAdmin Meeting Update for 9/15 Log in to post comments        SIG Sysadmin First Meeting     Submitted by walter on Sun, 09/07/2014 - 16:01      Hey Guys, So this is the official announcement I promised at the meeting yesterday and have a time and date for the first SIG Sysadmin meeting. As noted in the subject it will be at 5:30pm Monday, September 8th in SELE 2264. I would have liked to give people more lead time in notice, but unfortunately it currently looks like has to either be this coming Monday or get pushed back a week. If you are interesting in joining or just want to get more information on the SIG, but this time and day does not work at all then please send me an email to wdwora2 AT uic DOT edu and include some of your schedule details so we can work something out and if enough people respond I will look into other possibilities. The agenda for the meeting will be a general introduction of any current and potential members to the work space, systems, some software/hardware concepts, and to get a general idea of where everyone is at in experience and interests as to better plan for future meetings and get a many people moving in the right direction as possible from the get go. Before then I invite everyone to check out our SIGs area of the website, https://acm.cs.uic.edu/sigsysadmin, and our wiki, https://acm.cs.uic.edu/wiki, to start getting an idea of what things the ACM currently has, what some of our members have done so far, and to start thinking about what you would like to do and get out of the organization.
