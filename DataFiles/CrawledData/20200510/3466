The Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering offers master’s programs that are designed to serve a broad range of student needs and career objectives in the field. Many students complete these programs and move directly into higher-level jobs in industry and government agencies, while others use the degree as a springboard to doctoral-level study in mechanical or industrial engineering.  In the last five years, UIC has graduated 371 students with an MS in mechanical engineering, 229 with an MS in industrial engineering, and 119 with a master of energy engineering.  Get acquainted with these programs in our master’s degree overview booklet (PDF) .       UIC MIE offers three master's degree programs:     Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering   A 36-credit program with both thesis and coursework-only options. See details below.     Master of Science in Industrial Engineering   A 36-credit program with both thesis and coursework-only options. See details below.     Master of Energy Engineering   A non-thesis master’s program focusing on energy use in buildings and power generation. Visit the program website for details.          MS in Mechanical Engineering   Required Semester Hours: 36  Coursework-Only Option  In the coursework-only option, students complete all the credit hours toward the MS in Mechanical Engineering through coursework. There is no thesis. Requirements are as follows:   16 semester hours of 500-level courses in the department, excluding ME 596, ME 598, and ME 599. Of these courses, 12 hours must be ME courses.  An additional 20 semester hours of courses at the 400 level or 500 level. Up to 4 semester hours of ME 596 can be applied toward this requirement. Of these courses, 8 hours must be ME courses.  ME 595 Mechanical Engineering Seminar. Students must enroll in this course for every fall and spring semester.     Thesis Option  In the thesis option, students complete a suite of coursework in preparation for a master’s-level research project, which they execute with the support of a faculty advisor. The thesis option is strongly recommended for students who may consider going on for a PhD after finishing the MS program.
