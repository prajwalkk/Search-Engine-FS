Well SIG-Android is here with me, Lukasz Stempniewicz, who will be introducing people to programming with android! We will start from the very beginning and move on from there. This is my first time doing this so I'm not sure exactly how fast everyone will catch onto things, maybe everyone who comes has already programmed android and just wants to explore new features of the newest firmware? Who knows? If the group wants to go in a different direction later on and learn something else we can do that, or we may have a competition of some sort. I have planned the first 7 meetups already. My Email: lstemp2@uic.edu The Plan: Sig-Android will start during the second week of school Time: Tuesdays 4-5pm Location : Mac Labs - CS Labs Color Key ◖-Original Topic ◖-Added Topic  ◖-What was actually done   Week & Date Topics 1 - January 13 First week – No meetup 2 - January 20  Meetup #1 – Downloading/Installing software Finished topic, & finished creating virtual devices/created our first app, stuck on debugging physical devices 3 - January 27   Meetup #2 – Double checking that people are able to debug on their physical devices Using Android Studio/Key Concepts/Android Manifest  Finished Topic partially, Key Concept explored was the Activity.  4 - February 3  Meetup #3 – Buttons!
