The divisions are comprised of various cores that furthermore specialize in specific research techniques and areas. Support units work in collaboration with other cores to create all-in-one projects as well as offer specialized services to all customers.       Bioanalytics, Biophysics, & Cytomics Division        Biophysics Core  The Biophysics Core offers three main categories of research and services: characterization of macromolecules using various biophysical instruments (SPR, ITC, DLS, CD & AUC), large-scale protein production, and macromolecular structural biology using X-ray crystallography and Cryo-EM in collaboration.       Flow Cytometry Core  The Flow Cytometry Core (FCC) is a full operational facility with seven flow cytometers. We provide flow cytometry services for analysis and sorting of cells, as well as training and expert consultation for project/experiment planning.       High-Throughput Screening Core  HTSC is one of the most important tools in modern-day drug discovery that helps to automate and miniaturize the assay process, thereby significantly decreasing the cost and time commitments.       Mass Spectrometry Core  Beyond making available state-of-the-art, user-friendly facilities and services, the MSC laboratory enables education, methods development, and new applications development, designed to meet the fast-pace needs of researchers.       NMR Core  The NMRC Core provides access for researchers, staff, and students to high sensitivity, high-resolution solution state NMR instrumentation for studies of protein function, biochemical processes and natural products characterization projects.         Genome Research Division        Genome Research Core  The Genome Research Core (GRC) with a full suite of services as well as access to shared equipment for individual use.       Genome Research Core - Genome Editing Services  Services such as CRISPR/GeneEditing, CRISPR/GeneEditing NextGen Amplicon Sequencing, or CRISPR/GeneEditing Mouse Project.       Genome Research Core - DNA Services  Such as extraction, QC, analysis, and sequencing.       Genome Research Core - RNA Services  Such as extraction, QC, analysis, and sequencing.       Research Informatics Core  The Research Informatics Core (RIC) at the University of Illinois-Chicago (UIC) provides advanced computing and statistical expertise to support the analytic activities related to genetics, genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metagenomics, metabolomics, and proteomics.         Scientific Imaging & Nanotechnology Division        Cardiovascular Research Core  Provides advanced surgical and functional assessment services to create and evaluate rodent models of cardiovascular and pulmonary vascular disease.       Electron Microscopy Core  Provides cost-effective, safe and efficient access to state-of-the-art and core electron microscopy imaging and analytical characterization, and surface analysis by XPS or Raman.       Fluorescence Imaging Core  Works to accommodate any biological research that requires light, deconvolution, confocal, TIRF, and/or widefield fluorescent microscopy.       Nanotechnology Core Facility  Provides services in a wide-ranging areas of MEMS/NEMS, electronic and photonic material device design and fabrication.       Preclinical Imaging Core  Houses a 31cm bore size 9.4T Agilent MRI system that can provide the full support of MRS and MRI studies in small animals (including mouse, rat, rabbit); a 129Xe hyperpolarizer that is being installed to provide high-purity, hyperpolarized 129Xe for gas phase magnetic resonance studies.       Research Histology and Tissue Imaging Core  Provides high throughput histological and digital microscopy imaging services for reproducible, automated analysis of biomarkers expression levels in human and animal tissues as well as for measurements of spatial and temporal features of biological objects.         Research Support Division        Scientific Computing Core  Our staff has experience with a variety of computing architectures, commercial/open-source software and programming languages.       Scientific Instrument Shop  Construct and repair all types of mechanical and electronic/electrical equipment for the research, teaching and clinical requirements.       Scientific Storeroom  We carry a wide variety of items for the research lab, ranging from molecular biology reagents to office supplies.       UI Health Biorepository  The biorepository acquires, stores, catalogues, processes, analyzes, and provides tissue or other biological samples for investigators at UIC.
