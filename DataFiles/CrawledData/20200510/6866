To meet the high demand for well-educated management specialists in public service, CUPPA and PIP have worked closely together to offer excellent programs to students from partner universities and organizations.  Studies in public administration can focus on organizational governance, finance, and administration. A UIC degree in public administration prepares students to look into jobs in local, state, or federal government in public service sectors such as healthcare and public welfare, or non-profit organizations such as arts or international relief agencies.       Ranking        35 th   US News & World Report 2020 Best Graduate Schools Rankings puts the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs as 35th overall in the nation         3 rd   Ranked 3rd in urban policy (US News & World Report 2020 Best Graduate Schools Rankings)         12 th   Ranked 12th in public finance and budgeting (US News & World Report 2020 Best Graduate Schools Rankings)           Master of Public Administration (MPA) Program        Through collaboration with the UIC College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs, PIP is able to offer a 13-month Master of Public Administration (MPA) program. The goal of the degree program is to train individuals interested in public service, working for the government or non-profit organizations, or benefiting their community or country. All courses are taught by professionals and experts in their fields with outstanding reputations in research and teaching. The MPA Program is accredited by the Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs and Administration (NASPAA), which sets the global standard in public service education.  Students in the MPA program come from a variety of professional and academic backgrounds. This diversity is welcomed in the classroom as it offers the opportunity for classes to share their knowledge, opinions, and ideas in terms of public administration.  Please contact PIP to find more about degree requirements, curriculum, and admission standards for the MPA program.            3+2 Program in Public Administration        To meet the needs of specific students, PIP also offers the option of accepting junior undergraduate students to UIC for a one-year non-degree certificate program in public administration in order to better prepare them for the MPA program afterwards. Participants in this program will complete their final (senior) year of undergraduate study at UIC taking eight courses in public administration (six undergraduate level and two graduate level), and they will be awarded UIC credits and issued a transcript. A certificate of completion is presented to each participant following successful completion of the program.  To be admitted to the certificate program, an applicant is expected to have a GPA of at least 3.0 out of 4.0 in the undergraduate study, and pass an English proficiency exam administered by the UIC’s Programs for International Partnerships.  Please contact PIP to find more about curriculum and admission standards for the 3+2 Program.          Master of Public Policy (MPP) Program        The purpose of the Master of Public Policy program is to prepare students to better analyze and evaluate information in order to address complex policy issues.  The MPP degree emphasizes policy analysis, statistics, and program evaluation.  The program is ideal for students who complete undergraduate degrees in social sciences and humanities and who are seeking to strengthen their analytical skills, as well as those in hard sciences who have an interest in public affairs and public service. Students in the program can select to concentrate in a variety of specific policy areas including environment, health, and economic development.  Please contact PIP to find more about degree requirements, curriculum, and admission standards for the MPP program.          Master of Science in Civic Analytics (MSCA) Program        The Master of Science in Civic Analytics (MSCA) program is only the fourth dedicated public sector analytics degree offered in the US, and the second such degree offered in Illinois. The program will help meet the rapidly growing demand for data specialists nationally and locally. The purpose of the program is to provide an advanced data analytics education for practitioners in the government and nonprofit sectors. The curriculum provides a strong foundation in the areas of data analytics, applied statistics, geospatial applications, and data visualization, yet balanced with traditional core subjects in public affairs. The program seeks to develop substantial analytical capacity within its students for solving complex public problems. Graduates will have modern analytic and research skills that will be highly desirable in many employer contexts, including information offices in city, state, and federal agencies; large nonprofits; technology consulting firms, and government contractors.  Please contact PIP to find more about degree requirements, curriculum, and admission standards for the MSCA program.
