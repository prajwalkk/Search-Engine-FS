Submitted by walter on Wed, 01/27/2016 - 08:40     The public access to the ACM Gitlab instance located at acm.cs.uic.edu/git has been fixed and should now be accessable through normal means. Please report any further issues to webmasters AT acm.cs.uic.edu.  Read more about Gitlab Public Access FIXED! Log in to post comments        Gitlab Public Access Offline     Submitted by walter on Thu, 01/21/2016 - 10:04     Due to an unknown problem with our web hosting setup, the Gitlab web interface and repos are currently not accessable via acm.cs.uic.edu/git. We are working on steps to resolve the issue, but in the mean time you will be unable to push or pull from our git server. The Git reposiatories themselves are unaffected by this issue so any data on our system will be there when access is restored. Sorry for any inconveince this has caused.

In general, the service interruption lasts for only a few minutes. We are currently looking into the issue, but as of yet, we do not have any evidence as to why this actually happens. This issue is difficult to debug due to the fact that it does not appear to happen at any set intervals. The System Administrators will continue to look into the issue, however we do not currently have an estimate as to when this issue will be resolved. We will attempt some infrastructure changes over the next few months in order to mitigate the occurrence of these outages. We apologize for any inconvienences these outages may have caused. Affected Servers: ACM/LUG Workstations Most servers on internal IP ranges Affected Services: Internet Connectivity Wifi Internet Connectivity VOIP Phone Websites If you have any questions about this, please contact your friendly neighborhood Sysadmins at: sigsysadmin [at] acm.cs.uic.edu  Thanks, Chase Lee LUG President 2015-2016 ACM/LUG System Administrator  Read more about Intermittent Internet Connectivity - Fall 2015 Log in to post comments        Ongoing Unscheduled Server Downtime September 10, 2015     Submitted by clee231 on Thu, 09/10/2015 - 21:09     On September 10, 2015, system administrators were notified of a server issue.
