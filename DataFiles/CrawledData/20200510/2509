The practice of design is a responsibility and a privilege. It is an independent pursuit that precipitates collective action. Design advances the interplay between the exalted and the everyday, and stimulates an interchange between diverse disciplines. Serving as both unifying force and catalyst for change, the designer plays a pivotal role in the formulation and advocacy of ideas.  Chicago, one of the world’s great cities, is an ideal environment for the will of the designer-citizen: sharp-eyed, proactive, transcendent. UIC Design provides the impetus and critical forum necessary to amplify talent and quicken intuition, perfect skills and expand the intellect.       What our students say:  [a discipline] Yes, there are certain modes that need to be followed and traditions that need to be understood. Diana Acevedo BDes Graphic Design, 2012  [rigorous] This is true, but it sounds daunting and intimidating. The wording does not reflect the enjoyment and satisfaction that can come from design process. Raegan Budden BDes Graphic Design, 2012  [inquiry] Question everything! Instead of accepting something merely for what it is, and choosing not to understand it more, challenge it. Marisa Isaacs BDes Industrial Design, 2012  [questioning what is and what could be] Design is more than making something look good. Stephanie Chan BDes Industrial Design, 2012  One should never stop questioning why things are the way they are. Peter McGregory BDes Graphic Design, 2013  [priviledge] Interesting word for a public university… where we have access to an education for a privileged profession. Zach Sherwood BDes Graphic Design, 2013  [an independent pursuit that precipitates collective action] Design starts as an independent idea and comes full circle with the action of the users. Aubrey Sniegowski BDes Industrial Design, 2013  [Design advances the interplay between the exalted and the everyday] There is a connection between design that is very conceptual and design that is very plausible. Taylor Brinkman BDes Industrial Design, 2012  Higher ideas affect lower ideas and vice versa. Design is definitely a catalyst for this type of exchange. Charles Major BDes Graphic Design, 2013  [stimulates] Yes! There is an excitable energy with what we do. Zach Sherwood BDes Graphic Design, 2013  […stimulates an interchange between diverse disciplines] The UIC Design experience puts the student designer in a leadership role, working as a translator between disciplines. Robert Rettger BDes Industrial Design, 2013  We exist as translators… in most cases designers are the ones who listen, interpret, and act. Emily Maehl BDes Graphic Design, 2013  Through design, I've learned so much about psychology, philosophy, even history, and so much more. Charles Major BDes Graphic Design 2013  [diverse] Design can be expressed in many ways by many people. Tracy Tamika Bell BDes Industrial Design, 2012  [unifying force and catalyst for change] As a collective, designers have the ability to change society's everyday experience and to better the standard of living. Emily Hahn BDes Graphic Design, 2012  [catalyst for change] This is exactly what the design world is about, change. It is about making a difference in the world, whether it be how we see it or how we interact with it. Taylor Brinkman BDes Industrial Design, 2012  [Chicago] The city is such a tremendous asset. One sentence can't possibly capture it all. Zach Sherwood BDes Graphic Design, 2013  Studying at Chicago, among an amazingly diverse population, and at one of the best research universities, opens up the mind of a designer and makes him [or her] extremely aware. Sean Diller BDes Industrial Design, 2012  [one of the world's great cities] …with an amazing design legacy.  Oleg Eudokimov BDes Industrial Design, 2012  No, it is the greatest. Stephen Denning BDes Industrial Design, 2012  [ideal environment] This is a place where you can discover your passion and open up to new possibilities, and where you can start your career. Corey Ercoli BDes Industrial Design, 2012  [designer-citizen] It is interesting to think of a designer in this way. Robert Rettger BDes Industrial Design, 2013  [sharp-eyed] Designers are keenly perceptive. Paul Alex Chessare BDes Industrial Design, 2012  [sharp-eyed, proactive, transcendent] These are key attributes of a good designer: sharp-eyed as always looking at the world; proactive as having the gall to act quickly and effectively on a problem; transcendent enough to address any design need no matter what genre, environment, industry or social group. Kyle Jackson BDes Industrial Design, 2013  These are good words to describe the design scene in Chicago. Emily Maehl BDes Graphic Design, 2013  [transcendent] …going beyond ordinary limits; surpassing, exceeding! Melissa Alicea BDes Industrial Design, 2012  [critical forum] What is great is that you not only learn from your teachers but you learn new ideas from your peers. Mie Ikeda BDes Industrial Design, 2012  [UIC Design provides the impetus and critical forum necessary to amplify talent and quicken intuition, perfect skills and expand the intellect.] Allow your design experiences to broaden your horizons; allow yourself to become immersed in your studies; allow your personality to shine through in your creative process.
