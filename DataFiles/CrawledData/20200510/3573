Find out what you can expect!  The following shows one possible timeline for completion of the Minor in Life Science Visualization. You may elect to shorten or lengthen your timeline with your advisor to best fit with your other courses.  Semesters can be in either fall or spring.       Year 1    Year 1    Year 2         Semester 1    Semester 2       These pre/co-requisite courses may be taken at the same time as the courses in Semester 2. Semesters can be in either fall or spring.   Pre/Co-requisite Courses        BIOS 100  Biology of Cells and Organisms  5 hours    ART 112  Introduction to Drawing  4 hours          Semesters can be in either fall or spring. You will need to complete required course, BVIS 250, and complete one of the first elective Life Science Visualization courses.   Required Life Science Visualization Courses        BVIS 250  Life Science Visualization Techniques I  3 hours      Elective Life Science Visualization Course (choose at least 1)        BVIS 260  Biological Illustration Techniques  3 hours    BVIS 270  Constructing the Anatomical Figure  3 hours             Semester 3    Semester 4       You will need to complete a portfolio review for applying to the minor. Once you have taken some of your Life Science Visualization courses, this may be a good time to complete that task with the LSV faculty to demonstrate basic drawing competency.
