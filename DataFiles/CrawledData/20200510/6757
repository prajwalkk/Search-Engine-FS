Cancellation Policy   To cancel a reservation, written notice is required to UIC prior to occupancy. If notice of cancel­lation is received after a guest moves in, a refund for the number of unused nights minus a $25.00 administration charge will be assessed.  If the guest does not check in within three days of their scheduled arrival and has not given prior written notice of their late arrival to Housing, their housing reservation will be canceled. If payment has already been received by the University, the refund process, including a $25 administrative charge, will begin starting from the 4th day of the scheduled reservation.  If the guest vacates the room prior to the end of the scheduled stay without submitting a cancellation request to UIC Campus Housing and checking out and returning their keys at the residence hall desk, they will not receive a refund.
