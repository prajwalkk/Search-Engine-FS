Each committee member must be willing to do anything from boring repetitive tasks to public speaking. Above anything, motivation is a REQUIREMENT for being in this committee. There are things I will assign people to do and I expect them to be done in a timely fashion.    If you have any questions, come to the ACM office at anytime (I'm usually in the office after 5pm on weekdays). If I'm not present, ask one of the officers and they will either answer your questions or put you in contact with me.
