One of the many challenges is to develop interactive applications where users can hold a natural conversation with a computer. This has been the focus of the  NLP laboratory at UIC for many years, especially as concerns the computational modeling of extended text (discourse) and conversations between two or more agents (dialogue).  In the last 15 years, the lab has pursued what could be called NLP with a purpose : interfaces whose core is NLP technology and that have the potential of positively affecting society. In this vein, we have explored three main strands of research, briefly described below:       3 themes    Natural Language interfaces for educational technology    Summarization and recommender systems, including in the health sciences    Human-robot interaction           Research    Back to main content           Methodology and Foundational Work    NL for Educational Technology    Summarization for Entertainment and Healthcare    Human-Robot Interaction                   UIC Logo         Computer  Science  College Of  Engineering         Contact   Natural Language Processing Laboratory  bdieugen@uic.edu        Social Media Accounts            UIC.edu links   UIC.edu  Academic Calendar  Athletics  Campus Directory  Disability Resources  Emergency Information  Event Calendar  Job Openings  Library  Maps  UIC Safe Mobile App  UIC Today  UI Health  Veterans Affairs        Powered by Red 2.38.0  © 2020 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois |  Privacy Statement    Campuses   University of Illinois System  Urbana-Champaign  Springfield      Cookie Settings
