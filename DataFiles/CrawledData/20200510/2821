Yes! USN is created as a resource for students. All students are currently to sign-up for support groups and attend any Kickback Friday events.  What about graduate students?  We are now offering support groups for graduate students, beginning February 2020! Graduate students are also welcome at Kickback Friday events.  Who leads USN’s weekly groups? ​  Weekly Groups are led by UIC students. After an application and interview process, students complete PSCH 386 to master basic counseling skills and gain sensitivity training around various mental health struggles as well as various holistic health and well-being strategies. Group leaders also attend weekly consultation meetings where they receive additional ongoing training.  How do I sign-up?  You can sign up for groups anytime by clicking the link above! You are also welcome to attend our kickback Friday events.  How many students are usually in a specific Weekly Group?  Weekly groups usually consist of 4-12 students.  What happens during group?  Group is a place for members to talk about day-to-day stressors, gain support and strategies from each other, destigmatize mental health, and not have to feel alone! Group leaders will help guide the group around how to utilize the space and make sure it feels safe and inclusive for everyone.  When and where do Weekly Groups meet?  Groups are offered at various times and locations on campus to try to reach as many students as possible. Students can select a time and place that works best with their schedule of various times offered.  Is USN therapy?  USN is not therapy , and members do not enter into a professional relationship with peer leaders. It is a simply a safe, inclusive, and confidential environment for students to engage honestly with one another and support each other through life’s challenges. If you are seeking professional therapy, please contact the Counseling Center at 312-996-3490 to learn about options available.  Are groups confidential?  Yes. Once members join a group, leaders will not share any information that members share in the group with outside parties. We ask that members also agree to not disclose information shared in group with outside parties. Leaders may at times consult about their groups during ongoing trainings to ensure they provide members with a positive experience, but no names or identifying information will be shared to protect member privacy. A few rare exceptions to confidentiality do exist and will be discussed with members when groups begin.  Is weekly group only for students with mental health concerns?  No, weekly group is designed for all students, as we hope to address and promote mental health and well-being for all UIC students.
