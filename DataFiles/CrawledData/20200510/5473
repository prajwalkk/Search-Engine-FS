To strengthen this existing practice, this policy requires a formal process to guide the planning and design of UIC campuses according to the master plan and design standards. The process is further required to assure timely and thorough design review of a subset of projects—major capital construction projects with an overall budget exceeding $5 million—as the required first step before seeking Board of Trustees approval through the Audit, Budget, Finance and Facilities Committee.
