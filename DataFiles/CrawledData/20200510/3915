To solve problems in these areas, we are looking into fundamentals of phase change (boiling, condensation, icing/frost etc); liquid-liquid interactions (e.g. oil/water); solid-liquid interactions (e.g. wettability) . Our work spans from investigating above-mentioned phenomenon at macro scales to nano scales . Additionally, we seek to develop new techniques & materials that can influence the fluid-surface interactions to favorable outcomes.  In order to satisfy our need to understand+solve problems, we use experimental approaches involving advanced visualization and characterization tools, but at the same time we also do modeling/simulations to get a sense of the underlying physics behind the phenomenon.  Finally, we are strong believers of pursuing science for the sake of understanding the beauty of nature, and developing a deeper appreciation of the machinery of life.
