First off, it’s ok to not be ok! Mental illness is an illness just like any other. If you have the flu, you go to the doctor, you rest, you take care of yourself…So why is this so hard when we experience depression or anxiety? Sadly, there is a lot of stigma surrounding mental health and mental health treatment. But just like any other illness, it is important to take care of yourself. Don’t worry what others think or say, your top priority needs to be taking care of yourself. Never forget, your feelings and emotions are important and they are valid. The things you are feeling are very real and not “all in your head.” Mental illness is an illness and everyone deserves help and treatment.       What can you do?   If you’re nervous or unsure of where to start, do some research! Whether you’re looking for treatment options or just want to educate yourself, there are so many resources right at your fingertips. If you are looking for resources within the UIC community, you can visit the UIC Counseling Center in the Student Services Building (SSB) in suite 2010 or check out their website at https://counseling.uic.edu/ .

Educate yourself and try to share your resources with them.  College is one of the most stressful things that you will ever experience!
