Temporary remote teaching is not the time to adopt new teaching approaches. Blackboard Learn, UIC’s Learning Management System, has simple tools to help you transition your class online temporarily.  This page has links to how-to videos, quick guides, webinars, and recommendations to help make the transition to remote teaching more manageable. There are planned webinars and “ virtual office hours ” to help instructors use Blackboard Learn and Blackboard Collaborate. Please sign up if you need help.  Due to the large volume of requests we are receiving, you may experience delays for some requests as we prioritize them. The LTS team is working as efficiently as possible to provide the quality of service you are accustomed to.      General Recommendations         General Recommendations   We recommend the following tools to maintain academic momentum:   Blackboard Collaborate to present your lectures  Blackboard Discussions to hold class conversations using discussion forums through Blackboard Learn  Blackboard Email to communicate with all students at once through Blackboard Learn  UIC Email using Outlook or your preferred email tool to answer questions for specific students or to send FAQs   The tools above should transition most classes to an online environment smoothly without adding additional anxiety for you and your students. Other courses that normally use face-to-face teaching approaches, such as labs and hands-on skills development like theater and music, may still use Blackboard to maintain communication and share documents with their students.        Basic Technology Required for Instructors         Basic Technology Required for Instructors    Laptop or desktop computer  Chromebooks are used to perform a variety of browser-based tasks with most data and applications, such as Blackboard Learn, Blackboard Collaborate, Google Docs, and Office 365, residing in the cloud rather than on the machine itself. This can result in reduced functionality.  Tablets can work, but the functionality is typically reduced.    Microphone – while this may be built into your computer, we recommend using an external device such as a USB microphone or headset.  Internet – either commercially provided (e.g., Comcast, AT&T), or a wireless hotspot through your mobile phone.  Many service providers are offering connectivity solutions for students without access to wifi or internet. The Illinois Citizens Utility Board is maintaining a comprehensive list of the available options here: citizensutilityboard.org/blog/2020/03/19/cubs-guide-utility-services-during-the-covid-19-public-health-emergency/ .    Optional: Webcam – a camera may already be built into your laptop; if not, you can use an external USB camera for video conferencing.         Basic Technology Required for Students         Basic Technology Required for Students    Laptop, Chromebook, or desktop computer  Note that Chromebooks are used to perform a variety of browser-based tasks with most data and applications, such as Blackboard Learn, Blackboard Collaborate, Google Docs, and Office 365, residing in the cloud rather than on the machine itself. This can result in somewhat reduced functionality, depending on your needs.  Tablets and phones can work, particularly for joining/participating in online class sessions. Functionality to complete assignments is typically reduced, depending on their needs.  If any of your students note that they do not have reliable access to a computer at home, ACCC may have a laptop to lend to them. Please direct them to fill out our request form at https://accc.uic.edu/forms/laptop-request/    Internet – Many service providers are offering connectivity solutions for students without access to wifi or internet. The Illinois Citizens Utility Board is maintaining a comprehensive list of the available options here: citizensutilityboard.org/blog/2020/03/19/cubs-guide-utility-services-during-the-covid-19-public-health-emergency/ .  The State of Illinois is maintaining a map of publicly available internet hotspots across the state that can be used for academic-related needs. These hotspots are available from within a parked vehicle. The map, and additional information, can be viewed at www.ildceo.net/wifi  Additionally, the ACCC has a very limited supply of cellular hotspots available for those students who are unable to take advantage of the above offers. Please direct them to fill out our request form at accc.uic.edu/forms/hotspot-request/           Contingency Plan         Prior to the Contingency   Prior to the Contingency   Test access to your equipment and resources at home before the need arises and ask your students to do the same. Contact us at LTS@uic.edu if you have any questions or problems.  Contact your students prior to the first class date date and send a reminder for the first virtual class. Be clear with your instructions on how you will use Blackboard and Blackboard Collaborate to manage your class, and the way students will need to contact you if they have questions.  Set clear expectations about your availability and your estimated response time; 48 hours to respond to an email is a standard response time for online courses.   During the Contingency   Maintain the same scheduled time and day of your in-person class for your Blackboard Collaborate sessions. This ensures that students who attend your class do not need to adjust their schedules to participate.  Relocate your office hours to Blackboard Collaborate. If you expect many students, you can use a discussion board prompt in Blackboard to gather topics; then, address specific topics on Blackboard Collaborate.  Ask your students to email you to arrange a Webex meeting or Zoom meeting to address individual students as needed.  Prepare the content that you will share with your students before the Collaborate session. Formulas and diagrams should be prepared ahead of time or scanned. Be realistic about what can be done in an online session. Your goal is not necessarily to provide the exact same in-class experience, but to identify and address teaching and learning priorities during the disruption.  Proctored testing is not practical in temporary remote teaching. Instead, consider holding final exams that carry less weight, e.g. “take-home” exams. Projects and multiple take-home tests may better reflect student learning in the case of a contingency.  Students may have additional challenges that can amplify during times of stress or uncertainty. Reach out individually to students who were attending on-campus classes but are missing virtual classes. Don’t ignore expressed student needs (i.e. advising, counseling services, financial aid, etc.) and direct them to the proper student support services if needed.         Host Meetings or Classes Online Using Web Conferencing Tools         Host Classes Online Using Web Conferencing Tools   Host classes, lecture, office hours or 1-on-1 meetings with students using web conferencing tools.  Blackboard Collaborate, Webex, Zoom and Google Hangouts are available to UIC faculty:  Blackboard Collaborate  Blackboard Collaborate is a web conferencing system that facilitates real-time online teaching and learning.Blackboard Collaborate is available to all UIC Blackboard users. Instructors and TAs can create individual (and repeat) web conferencing sessions on their own without requesting a session to be created or activated.  Webex Meetings  Host a video and/or audio conference with integrated collaboration tools such as whiteboard, chat, and screen share. While hosts need a Webex account to initiate meetings, participants are not required to have an account.  Zoom  Host a video and/or audio conference with integrated collaboration tools such as whiteboard, chat, and screen share. While hosts need a Zoom account to initiate meetings, participants are not required to have an account.  Learn more about protecting your Zoom sessions from “Zoomboming”.  Google Meet  Host a conversation, video call, or phone call with up to 250 people at a time, and collaborate on Google documents. Google Meet sync automatically across devices. Users must create a UIC G Suite account to use Google Meet.        Assessment & Online Proctoring         Remote Assessment & Online Proctoring   As the COVID-19 situation becomes more widespread and remote teaching is extended, students may need to take exams from off-campus locations.  You can use Blackboard to test student knowledge and collect assignments. Remind your students that they should use a wired connection when they take tests whenever possible. Wireless connections are more prone to network issues, as the stability of the signal depends on how long and how much bandwidth students draw, similar to 4G phone data connections.  Using Blackboard for Assessment & Grade Management  The following can be accomplished using Blackboard:   Distribute and collect assignments. Learn how with the Blackboard Assignments video (10 min)  Deliver tests. Learn how with the Blackboard Tests video (12 min)  Score with rubrics. Learn how with the Rubrics: Make Grading Easier video (7 min)  Grade electronically and provide feedback. Read how to Record Audio and Video at Blackboard Help webpage  Post grades and maintain a digital gradebook. Learn how with the Navigating the Grade Center video (10 min) or by reading the Navigating Grading Blackboard Help webpage .   If you are not familiar with Blackboard assessments, here are some suggestions:   Consider posting a low-stakes Blackboard quiz for practice  Use multiple-choice and true/false questions at first to practice creating questions.  Work up to essay questions once you’re comfortable with creating auto-graded questions like multiple choice and true/false.    Create assignments to be turned in online:  Post and collect a practice assignment in Blackboard  SafeAssign may be used on assignments (Original & Ultra) or test essay questions (Ultra only) to determine the originality of student work.     Prevent Cheating  We recommend using alternatives to timed, proctored exams wherever possible. Large courses reliant on in-person exams should consider open-book exams or frequent low-stakes assessments as alternative assessment strategies that are relatively easy to grade.  While cheating is sometimes unavoidable, there are strategies you can use to minimize cheating if your students have to take low-stakes tests remotely.  Strategies to minimize cheating in Blackboard tests and quizzes   Be transparent with students about the learning goals and assessment strategies.  Ask students an honor code question at the beginning of the test in Blackboard. (e.g., “As a member of the UIC community, I have agreed to act with honesty and integrity in all of my academic work, including this test.” True or False)  Avoid easy-to-cheat formats such as multiple-choice or true/false answer questions for high-stakes tests.  Ask complex, specific questions such as: “Define how a particular situation impacts your community.” Try to think about questions that won’t be likely to be found using a quick online search.  Use Blackboard’s SafeAssign tool for essay assignments to help detect plagiarism. To help alleviate student anxiety, integrate learning activities that emulate the format of a higher-stakes assignment before asking them to produce the final work. Diversify assessment formats by relying less on essays and written exams and more on using students’ presentations.  Design assignments with process questions, rather than single answers.  Design open-book or collaborative exams.   For more strategies to avoid cheating while using Blackboard Tests, refer to this answer about common cheating situations and how to prevent them .  Minimize cheating by designing alternative assessments   Ask students to present during class via Blackboard Collaborate, either individually or in groups.  Have students produce Panopto or YouTube videos and submit their presentations in Blackboard.  Ask students to create posters or presentations that can be shared and online using Google Slides.  Create open-book, take-home assessments with process questions, rather than single answers.   Online Proctoring  The university has just secured an institution-wide license for Respondus LockDown Browser and Respondus Monitor , which provide online proctoring to help ensure academic integrity for exams.  Respondus is available only via Blackboard from the Tools menu in all of your courses. In order for you to use it, your exam must be on Blackboard. Once you create a standard Blackboard Test, you can require the Respondus LockDown Browser software to limit what can be done on the computer during the test. You can also use Respondus Monitor, which will proctor the student with the use of a web camera and video recording during the exam.  Before deciding to use Respondus to proctor your exams, you may want to consider holding final exams that carry less weight and have more built-in flexibility, e.g. “take-home” exams. Under conditions of social distancing, students may not have access to an interruption-free space, and they may face challenges to the focused attention needed for time-based testing. Projects and multiple low stakes take-home tests may better reflect student learning during the current contingency. You may also want to explore using alternative types of assessments such as group projects, recorded video presentations, etc.  Please review this brief tutorial on Academic Continuity for Exams to learn more about online testing, alternative assessments, and the use of Respondus and exams in Blackboard: go.uic.edu/remote-assessment  Be flexible if you are using Respondus. Your students didn’t sign up for an online class, so make sure they are not penalized for not having access to the proper technologies at home.  Below are some important considerations:   Consider what to do if your students only have a Chromebook or tablet, as they won’t be able to use Respondus. Respondus requires a computer or laptop to run.  Consider what to do if your students don’t have a camera or their WiFi is not stable, both requirements for Respondus to work properly.  Consider what to do if a student finds that Respondus does not interface well with the access technology they use, like screen readers or voice-to-text software. Be aware that any Letters of Accommodations that stipulate testing accommodations must still be honored, so invite students to reach out to you to discuss how to best implement any approved accommodations in this new format.  Consider that your students may have privacy concerns about third-party recorded remote proctoring. Respondus is intended to be invasive and take control of the students’ computer during testing. Your students didn’t register for an online course, so you will need to make accommodations for these students.         Video Tutorials for Blackboard & Other Teaching Technologies         Blackboard and Other Teaching Technologies Video Tutorials   Blackboard Tutorial for First-Time Users  Blackboard Learn and Blackboard Collaborate can help by providing a variety of services to connect instructors and students remotely so that work and learning can continue uninterrupted.
