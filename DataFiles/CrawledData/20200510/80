Whether you live on campus or commute, there’s a place for you here at University of Illinois at Chicago.          Campus Housing        With housing options all over campus, students can experience all UIC and Chicago have to offer. Many undergraduates live on the east side of campus, in the Commons North, Commons South, Commons West and Courtyard residence halls. Students who live here are minutes from lecture halls, Student Center East and the Student Recreation Center.  Students in the residence halls in the south side of campus — James Stukel Towers, Marie Robinson Hall and Thomas Beckham Hall – wake up to views of the Chicago skyline. Students are close to the new Curtis Granderson Stadium, home to the UIC Flames baseball team, and restaurants and shops on Halsted and Maxwell streets.  Polk Street Residence Hall and the Single Student Residence hall on the west side of campus are near UIC’s health science colleges, Student Center West and lively Taylor Street.        Campus Housing                    Living Learning Communities   Campus Housing offers  Living Learning Communities (LLC), giving you the option to live with students with similar majors and interests. They offer a sense of community through programs, conversations, and faculty interaction. Campus Housing also has free tutoring for all students choosing to live on campus.    More about Living Learning Communities            Off-campus housing        UIC sits among many culturally rich neighborhoods, such as Greektown, South Loop, West Loop, Pilsen, Little Italy and Chinatown. University Village is a recently revamped community that’s trendy, student-oriented and only a few blocks from campus. On the CTA bus and “L,” most neighborhoods are just a few minutes away from UIC.      Off-campus housing              Dining        Whether or not you live in campus housing, UIC has meal plans you can purchase and use at cafeterias  across campus. UIC has All-You-Care-To-Eat anytime dining at designated locations.  A variety of dining options – from fast-food eateries to cultural cuisine – are in the Student Centers.

Intracampus routes are accessible, and additional paratransit service options are available on campus seven days a week.  Walking can be a quick and healthy way to get around campus; you can get from one side of campus to the other in less than 30 minutes! Just remember, when walking in any major metropolitan city, be aware of your surroundings. The UIC Police recommend to be aware of the people walking behind you and next to you.
