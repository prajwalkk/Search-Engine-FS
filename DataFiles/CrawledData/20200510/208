Summer 2020  The Summer 2020 CTA U-PASS program will be completely different than in any previous semester.  Please read carefully.  For Summer 2020 ONLY, the CTA U-PASS is being offered to students who OPT-IN to the program. The 2020 CTA summer U-PASS will be available for any full-time summer session student that elects to OPT-IN prior to a May 10 deadline. Unfortunately, no exceptions can be made to missing this deadline.  The Summer UPASS will be active from June 1 through August 12, and the corresponding fee of $94 will be applied to your student account after the June 1 start date. As this is not a mandatory fee this summer, it will not be included in your FInancial Aid “cost of attendance.”  This benefit is only available to full-time (6  credit hours for Undergraduate/Professional, 5  credit hours Graduate) summer session students. Students who opt-in, but are not registered as full-time students will not be eligible and will not be assessed the fee.   Summer U-PASS will be active from June 1 through August 12    The deadline to OPT-IN for summer session UPASS is May 10th at Midnight CDT  After May 10th, the opt-status cannot change for the duration of the summer session  Students who drop below full-time status prior to the add/drop deadline will have their U-PASS deactivated.  All students are opted-out by default unless otherwise specified by the student at the website below   In order to opt-in to receive the summer U-PASS benefit, please visit the following website to confirm and provide a shipping address where any new U-PASS will be shipped. For students with existing U-PASS cards, the standard policies on lost/replacement cards will still be enforced.
