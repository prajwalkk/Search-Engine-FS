It is the conceptualization and creation of new things: ideas, interactions, information, objects, typefaces, books, posters, products, places, signs, systems, services, furniture, websites, and more.  Designers imagine and make. They also research and think. Skilled in one or more specialties of the discipline, designers use their abilities in collaboration with others. Designers want to make ideas real and to make a difference.  A career in design is more than a job. It is a way of seeing; a way of interacting with the world. It is a way of life.        Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones. Herbert Simon, Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, 1978.  Why Design?
