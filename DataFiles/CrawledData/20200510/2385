Introductions and open-forum discussion of topics of your choosing.  About Talk code! This SIG gives you the opportunity to discuss coding topics with students of various skill and academic levels. The goal of this SIG is to help students refine their communication skills in an informal environment to prepare them for the collaborative work they will have to participate in when in a professional environment. I will act as a facilitator of conversations, encouraging dialogue amongst the group. We will not be doing your homework for you! But we do encourage feedback, ideas, and open dialogue to help optimize code.
