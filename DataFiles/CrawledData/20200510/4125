Minimum requirements for student teaching include senior standing; 3.00/4.00 GPA in the professional course work; a grade of C or higher in all course work required for licensure; courses taken for a credit/no credit option are not applicable towards licensure; satisfactory completion of fieldwork as assessed by university field instructors and school mentor teachers. Furthermore, it is required that students meet the following additional criteria: approval of the program faculty through review of performance according to the GPA; Council of Education (CTE) Conceptual Framework; development of the Teaching Portfolio; and the passing of the required state tests. EE candidates should also consult the State Teacher Licensure section below. The edTPA is required during student teaching.

State Teacher Licensure  The curricula for the preparation of elementary and secondary school teachers as listed in this catalog have been approved by the Illinois Board of Higher Education, the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, the Illinois State Board of Education, and the university.  Council on Teacher Education  The Council on Teacher Education (CTE) is responsible for coordinating teacher education programs throughout the University of Illinois at Chicago and for maintaining relationships with the Illinois State Board of Education.  Decisions about licensure are a joint effort of a candidate’s program, the Council on Teacher Education (CTE), and the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE). The program coordinator and faculty have the main responsibility for ensuring that candidates are prepared to become teachers and are, thus, entitled to apply for licensure. They approve qualifications before the CTE begins its process of evaluation. The CTE’s licensure officer entitles an individual to apply for a license at the state level. The CTE checks that candidates have met state requirements, such as passing the required state-level tests and completing the course, assessment, and grade requirements stipulated by the program as addressing state objectives. Teacher candidates must successfully complete the Education Test of Teacher Performance Assessment (edTPA) in order to be licensed. ISBE makes the final decision about whether or not a candidate receives licensure based upon the information it receives from the institution and a candidate’s application.  State Examinations  Prior to licensure, the candidate must also pass a series of examinations required by the Illinois State Board of Education. An Illinois-approved test of basic skills must be passed prior to applying for candidacy in the teacher education program.  Approved tests consist of the  ACT or SAT with approved scores.  The tests must have been taken within 10 years of application.   To use an ACT score, the following criteria must be met:  ACT composite score must be at least 22; and  ACT combined English/Writing score must be at least 19 for tests prior to September 2015; or  ACT writing score must be at least 16 for tests taken September 2015 to September 8, 2016; or  ACT writing score must be at least 6 for tests taken September 9, 2016 or after.​    ​To use an SAT score, the following criteria must be met:  SAT combined score (critical reading and math) of at least 1030 and SAT writing score of at least 450 for tests taken prior to March 5, 2016.  SAT combined score (evidence-based reading and writing plus mathematics) of at least 1110 and a minimum score of 26 on writing and language tests for tests taken on or after March 5, 2016.     Note: As identified in the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE's) Teach Illinois: Strong Teachers, Strong Classrooms report, beginning  June 30, 2019 , the Test of Academic Proficiency (TAP 400) will be put on hold indefinitely while ISBE conducts a study of alternative basic skills assessments.  The last day to register for the TAP is June 27, 2019.  TAP tests passed prior to June 30, 2019, will continue to be accepted to meet the Illinois basic skills requirement past June 30, 2019.  ISBE will continue to require specific scores on the ACT or SAT as a test of basic skills for the issuance of a Professional Educator License as referenced above.  The Illinois Content Area Test must be passed before the candidate is allowed to student teach. The Educational Test of Teacher Performance Assessment (edTPA) must be passed prior to licensure. These tests are administered and monitored by the State of Illinois. The candidate is responsible for meeting this requirement. See the NES website for the available test dates, registration information, and study guides. Registration information can also be found in the Council on Teacher Education. Students and candidates must take the tests in sufficient time for the results to accompany the appropriate application.  Program Pass Rates  In accordance with the public disclosure requirements of Title II of the Higher Education Act, the University of Illinois at Chicago reports that teacher education program completers scored as follows on the two assessments required by the state for teacher licensure. During the 2017–2018 academic year, UIC program completers had a 100% pass rate on the two required exams, Test of Academic Proficiency and Content Area Test. For both years, the statewide pass rate on the required exam was 100%.  Student Teaching  All TCs must apply to the Chicago Public Schools prior to any fieldwork. This registration process includes a background check (Illinois State Police and FBI). In order to student teach, TC’s must apply to both the CTE and the Chicago Public Schools. The application to the CTE includes documentation of a passed TB test and a passed Content Area Test. Then, in order to student teach within the Chicago Public Schools, TCs must complete a separate CPS registration packet, which includes another criminal background check. TCs are expected to bear the expense of both the TB test and the criminal background check. Students receive instructions for both the fieldwork application and the student teaching applications from the CTE.  Middle School Licensure  Middle Grades Endorsement is offered as an advanced endorsement in Grades 5–8. Please consult the program advisor for additional information to see how the advanced Grades 5–8 endorsement can be added to the initial Professional Educator License.  Other Licensure Policies (or Requirements)  Per legislation signed in August 2011, the Illinois State Board of Education no longer requires Teacher Education candidates to prepare and sign form 73-91 (Notice of Intent to Become a United States Citizen) or, to verify their legal presence and eligibility for employment in the United States. All candidates will apply for their teaching credential online via the Educator Licensure System. Please note that, in some cases, the State of Illinois will not issue a teaching credential to an individual who has been convicted of a criminal offense. A candidate who has been convicted of an offense should notify his/her advisor immediately.
