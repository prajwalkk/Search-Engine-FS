It has been reviewed, approved, and formally adopted to provide a concept of operations for each phase of emergency management, and is designed to facilitate a timely, effective, efficient, and coordinated university response.  The EOP is prepared in compliance with the Campus Security Enhancement Act of 2008 (110 ILCS 12/1 et seq.).  The University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences Systems (UI Health) has its own Emergency Management Plan, but will integrate maintenance and sustainment activities through a collaborative process with university stakeholders, through transparency and information sharing, collaborative planning, training and exercise initiatives, and a continuities review and evaluation and prioritization of response and recovery protocols that benefit the entire university.
