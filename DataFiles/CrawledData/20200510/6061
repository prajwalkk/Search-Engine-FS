April 20, 2020  Vitalant to begin collecting plasma from individuals who have recovered from coronavirus to help COVID-19 patients Since 2014, The University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System has partnered with Vitalant for supply of blood products and transfusion services.   Convalescent Plasma: What Is It and How Do Patients Benefit? Those who have completely recovered from COVID-19 may have immune-boosting antibodies in their plasma—called “convalescent plasma”—that could be used to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients. The Food and Drug Administration just allowed the transfusion of convalescent plasma as an investigational treatment. It’s currently the only antibody treatment available for COVID-19 patients.   Who is Eligible to Donate Convalescent Plasma and Where Will It Be Collected? Current criteria include: •prior diagnosis of COVID-19, documented by a laboratory test •complete resolution of symptoms for at least 14 days •a current negative test result for COVID-19 •all other donor eligibility for blood donation Vitalant does NOT test for COVID-19. Do not donate blood if you are sick. The donor must present the appropriate documentation to Vitalant donation center staff upon check-in.   Are you a potential donor who has completely recovered from COVID-19? Thank you for your interest in helping patients. Please contact us at 312-413-5972 and we will provide you with additional information about how to qualify as a convalescent plasma donor.
