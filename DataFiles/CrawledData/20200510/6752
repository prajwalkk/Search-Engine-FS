Current Housing residents wishing to apply for housing, please contact Campus Housing at housing@uic.edu.       ReApp application is available now!      ReApp application available beginning on February 3, 2020  If you are a current Campus Housing resident, ReApp is your opportunity to select your specific room for the future academic year (Fall 2020 & Spring 2021).  The ReApp process takes place in multiple steps.  Beginning February 3, all students currently living in Campus Housing will either apply for ReApp or submit their intent to not return to Campus Housing for the future academic year.  As part of the initial ReApp application, current residents will indicate their preference to live in their Same (current) Room, to live in an LLC, or to live on campus in a new room (that is not in an LLC-designated space – see Special Designations ).  ReApp participants will then be contacted via their UIC email when they can select their room and/or sign their contract online.  For more support, please visit our ReApp Frequently Asked Questions or call us at 312-355-6300 between the hours of 8:30AM – 5:00PM, Monday – Friday.

Students living on campus generally perform better academically than students who don’t live on campus.
