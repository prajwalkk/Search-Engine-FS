In the past, I have investigated various methods for automatic verification of these systems using such models as finite automata and Petri nets. In recent years, I have shifted my main research focus to the automatic generation of control supervisors for discrete manufacturing systems. For instance, I codirected NIST-sponsored project seeking to generate automatically supervisory controllers for discrete manufacturing plants. More generally, I am now interested in techniques for supervisory control and dynamic reconfiguration of discrete event systems. An additional application is the automatic correction of multi-threaded Java programs required to be free of deadlock and to comply with user-specified safety properties. Additional interests include software development for multicore hardware, mobile app development, and sensor networks.  Teaching:  I usually teach courses on object-oriented programming languages (CS 342 and CS 474), software engineering (CS 342, CS 440, CS 442 and CS 540), and mobile app development (CS 478). In the past, I have also taught introductory computer-science classes (CS 100 and CS 101), data structures (CS 201), and theory classes (CS 301 and CS 401).  List of courses that I taught:   CS 100  CS 101  CS 201  CS 301  CS 342  CS 401  CS 440  CS 442  CS 474  CS 478  CS 540  CS 594   Professional Activities:   Organization committee member for Petri Nets '93, 14th International Conference on Application and Theory of Petri Nets, Chicago, Illinois, June, 1993.
