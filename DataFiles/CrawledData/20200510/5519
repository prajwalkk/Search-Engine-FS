We greatly appreciate the numerous phone calls and emails we have received and would like to provide the information below on how you may help take action.  Much like what we see happening across the world, UIC faculty, staff and students are offering their time, energy and ideas to creatively account for issues related to testing, capacity and PPE supplies. This outreach and outpouring of support is incredibly valued and a testament to the resilience of our community. To best serve our patients and communities, it is important that these efforts be organized and then authorized by our leading infectious disease, public health and emergency preparedness experts.

We are asking principal investigators, clinic or lab managers to complete this resource inventory survey as soon as possible.  Please note there are separate sections of this survey that include information about RNA extraction capabilities and PPE supplies (gloves, gowns, face masks/shields, N95 respirators, etc.). We ask that you complete this survey as best as you are able.   COMPLETE THE UIC PPE & LAB SUPPLY SURVEY HERE         OVCHA Follow-up instructions   The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs will categorize, assess and prioritize this information in concert with our University and Hospital Incident Command Teams. A member of OVCHA will then reach out to the primary contact indicated on the form with additional follow-up and instructions.  Some of these resources and ideas may be mobilized immediately, while others will help to serve the anticipated needs in the coming weeks. Any financial implications can be addressed at that time or a later date; particularly, if supplies were purchased with restricted funding.
