Through these experiences students are able to apply and connect what they are learning both in and outside the classroom. The approach to developing the student learning outcomes framework for Student Affairs is based on the premise that students first acquire knowledge related to these learning domains, are given the opportunity to apply the skills learned through their out of the classroom experiences, and ultimately intergrate these skills into their lives to serve them beyond their time at UIC. Recognizing the student experience involves moving in and out of programs and across units over a cumulative and collective period of time four levels of learning shaped the development of the learning outcomes for Student Affairs:   Divisional Learning Outcomes  allow for integration and shared responsibility for student learning across units.  Departmental Learning Outcomes  define what students will learn through multiple programs and services offered within a unit.  Programmatic Learning Outcomes  define what students can achieve through participating in one or more activities or services within one program area of a unit.  Activity Based Learning Outcomes  define what students can achieve through participation in a singular activity or service at one point in time.   The four broad learning domains for UIC Student Affairs adopted include:  Cognitive Skills  Resiliency & Practical Skills  Intrapersonal & Interpersonal Skills  Diversity & Social Responsibility  Based on these four learning domains Blooms and Krathwohl’s taxonomy (1956, 2002) was used as the guiding framework to write the divisional learning outcome statement for each learning domain. Here are the Student Affairs divisional learning outcomes for each learning domain.      Student Affairs divisional learning outcomes       Learning Domain  Domain Descriptors  Student Affairs Learning Outcome Statement      Cognitive Skills  Critical Thinking/Problem Solving, Academic Success Skill Development, Reflective Thinking, Intellectual Flexibility, Creativity  Students who engage with UIC Student Affairs programs and services will be able to evaluate problems, issues, and questions through cognitive strategies to make meaning of their integrated experiences.    Resiliency & Practical Skills  Life Skills/Resilience, Career Development, Communication Skills, Health and Wellness  Students who engage with UIC Student Affairs programs and services will be able to manage personal and professional experiences, behaviors, and skills to confidently achieve life-long success.    Intrapersonal & Interpersonal Skills  Self-Awareness & Understanding, Purpose/Personal Mission, Ethics, Meaningful Relationships, Collaboration & Teamwork  Students who engage with UIC Student Affairs programs and services will be able to construct a personal identity with a sense of self that positively contributes to meaningful, collaborative and interdependent relationships.    Diversity & Social Responsibility  Social Justice, Intersectionality/Intercultural Competence, Leadership, Community Engagement, Civic Engagement  Students who engage with UIC Student Affairs programs and services will be able to synthesize skills to identify differences with respect to multiple perspectives, while acknowledging and constructively challenging one’s own biases and maintaining a commitment to civic engagement in the pursuit of equity and social change.         While often knowledge acquisition, application, and integration are represented as a separate domain, learning in that context is inherent, implied, and progressive in the domains selected for UIC Student Affairs.
