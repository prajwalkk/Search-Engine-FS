I am particularly interested in layout optimization, logic synthesis, programmable devices and timing optimization. I also have an interest in bridging so-called ``optimization disconnects'' between traditionally sequential design phases (e.g., between logic synthesis and physical design). This work is essentially applied combinatorial optimization and so I have a natural interst in areas such as local search, Integer Linear Programming, optimality studies, and lower bounding techniques.
