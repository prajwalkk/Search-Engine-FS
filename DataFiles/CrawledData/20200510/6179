Preference will be given to residents of Illinois ( Illinois Residency Guidelines ; State Regulations );  Have earned a bachelor's degree conferred no later than June of the matriculation year from an accredited United States college or university located in the US; any additional degrees listed on the dental school application must be posted no later than June of the matriculation year.  Have completed all required coursework (outlined below) with a grade of "C" or better from an accredited US college or university by June of matriculation year (There are no limitations on junior college work, but it is recommended that most work be completed at a 4-year institution.);  Meet the Safety and Technical Standards of the program    Required Coursework  All prospective students must have completed the following courses prior to dental school matriculation:  Chemistry 14 semester hours (21 quarter hours), with at least 4 semester hours in Organic Chemistry (6 quarter hours)  Biological Science 6 semester hours (9 quarter hours)  Physics 6 semester hours (9 quarter hours)  English 6 semester hours (9 quarter hours)  1 course in Biochemistry (no lab required)  All dental school prerequisite science courses must include labs. This does not apply to elective science courses.  Advanced Placement (AP) courses are not accepted as course requirements. However, if basic level chemistry, biology or physics courses requirements are met with AP credit, students may take the specific number of credit hours in each area from upper level science courses (preferably at a 4-year university). Of note:  English AP credit coursework can be satisfied by enrolling in 6 hours of upper level Literature, Advanced Composition or Intensive writing classes. UIC and GPPA students should check with their advisors to ensure graduation requirements are satisfied.  ALL required prerequisite courses taken must be a grade of “C” or better  To be competitive , applicants are encouraged to take 3-4 upper level courses from the list of advanced science classes (lab not required but encouraged where possible):  Human Anatomy  Human Physiology  Histology  Microbiology  Cell Biology  Molecular Biology  Immunology  Genetics    DAT Exam  All applicants are required to take the Dental Admission Test (DAT) , sponsored by the American Dental Association. It is strongly suggested that applicants complete this test prior to the year they wish to enter school. DAT scores can only be accepted if it is taken 2 years prior to application. The DAT can be taken up to 3 times, but candidates must wait 90 days between exams. We provide DAT, GPA, and other information on current students  to interested applicants. The UIC College of Dentistry does not accept the Canadian DAT. There is no current minimum DAT score required to apply. Please note however, this is a competitive application component.  Get DAT Exam tips from current students  Grade Point Average  The UIC College of Dentistry does not have a minimum gpa required to apply. Please note, however, this is a competitive application component.    Letters of Recommendation  The College requires three letters of recommendation. One committee letter of recommendation will satisfy the three-letter requirement. We strongly recommend submitting two academic references, preferably from two science professors. A third letter from a dental professional (non-relative) that an applicant shadows is highly preferred. Letters will only be accepted electronically via The Associated American Dental Schools Application Service (AADSAS). Paper recommendations or emailed letters will not be accepted.  It is expected that letters are on professional letterhead with a signature.    Shadowing  Applicants to the UIC College of Dentistry are expected to demonstrate passion for the field. This is often obtained through shadowing experiences and exposure to dentistry. Students often shadow a variety of dentist, including general practitioners. It is recommended that applicants obtain 100 or more United States dental practice shadowing hours at the time of application submission.    Community Service/Volunteer Work  The UIC College of Dentistry prides itself on serving the underserved. Applicants are expected to have obtained a variety of experiences, including community service and volunteer work. The experiences do not have to be specifically dentistry related, but these experiences may be helpful to one's own understanding of selfless giving, compassion for others and exposure to diverse populations.    Research  Students are encouraged to become exposed to research where possible. UIC provides opportunities for prospective students to get involved in research .    The College of Dentistry is accepting applications from students who currently live in the U.S. and hold a valid visa status.
