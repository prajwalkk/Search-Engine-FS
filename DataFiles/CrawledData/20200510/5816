Please forward to all appropriate individuals in your unit who maintain PEALEAV or who answer questions regarding AVSL reporting.  An overview AVSL webinar will be held on May 20, 2020 at 10:00 AM. To register, please go to the following link: https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/3446374523865693709 .  Resource materials are available online on the UIC Human Resources website under https://hr.uic.edu/employees/time-off-leaves/academic-vacation-sick-leave/ .  Mass communications will NOT be sent to affected employees.  Therefore, if you have not already begun to collect the information, you may wish to share the information below with your affected academic employees.  As a reminder, University policy requires that AVSL be reported twice a year, in May and in September. Units should be collecting AVSL usage from employees in preparation for the first 2020 reporting period. This is particularly important for those leave-eligible employees who may be leaving campus on May 15, 2020.  The two AVSL reporting periods will be: August 16, 2019 through May 15, 2020, and May 16, 2020 through August 15, 2020. Because the University must report its liability to the State in June, it is critical this reporting be done for both 9/12 and 12/12 month employees.  ** AVSL usage information should be entered into Banner beginning May 16, 2020 and no later than June 6, 2020 for the first reporting period.** Colleges/units that currently use the University AVSL tool will not need to complete these steps.  Please refer to the instructions that were sent out by University System Human Resource Office.  As a general reminder, employees should NOT be entering their own leave usage in Banner. If one individual enters usage for all Academics in that unit, department, and/or college, a different individual must be identified to enter usage for that person. There are no exceptions to this process.  Remember that your employees should report any leave taken in hours, keeping in mind that one full-time day equals eight hours. For example, if your full-time employee used 10 vacation days and 2 sick days, you would report 80 hours of vacation leave used and 16 hours of sick leave used. As a reminder, Academic employees who are not eligible for overtime should be reporting absences in half- and full-day increments only (except when leave is taken under the Family and Medical Leave Act). Absences in increments less than half- or full-days should not be charged against vacation or sick leave balances. Part-time and alternative schedule employees report absences as appropriate based on their schedule. Generally speaking, the employee reports either half-day or a full-day based on their scheduled hours for the day.  Please note: When an employee separates from the University, departments are requested to use the same process in order to bring leave balances current for payout purposes.
