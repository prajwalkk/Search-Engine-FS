International Student, Scholar, and Employee Tax Obligations and Support - Filing Deadline, July 15 Updated: April 21, 2020     Each UIC
international student, scholar, and employee present in the U.S. during
calendar year 2019 must file at least one tax document with the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) in order to meet their tax filing obligation and properly
maintain immigration status. Individuals who earned U.S.-based income must file
additional documentation. The general deadline for 2019 tax filings has been extended to July 15, 2020 .    While the
Office of International Services cannot directly advise individuals on their
specific tax filing obligations, the office has organized two valuable resources
for the UIC international community:    Sprintax Tax Preparation Software  OIS will
again provide the UIC international community with discounted access to
Sprintax, the online tax prep software for non-residents in the U.S. Get help
filing your personal U.S. federal and state tax returns and access Sprintax’s
tax education library.     Current UIC international students and scholars - Access the Sprintax software by
    logging into your my.uic.edu portal using your NetID and password. In the search bar in the upper right
    corner, type “OSSS Applications.” In the OSSS Applications portlet, click
    “OIS Tax Service” for complete instructions.  F-1 students currently on OPT, J-1 students on Academic
    Training and UIC International Employees - OIS has sent an email to
    the addresses we have on file for you which contains the instructions for
    accessing Sprintax. If you have not received this email and believe you
    should, please contact us at ois@uic.edu with your full name and UIN.     Tax Workshop for International Students,
Exchange Visitors and Employees  During this
workshop a local tax professional will provide an overview of non-immigrant tax
responsibilities and filing requirements. Please note that this workshop is
general in focus and not intended to provide one-on-one tax preparation
services or advice nor will it cover how to use the Sprintax tax preparation
software.    Workshop
