The intern will rotate through a variety of shifts and specialty units to understand the numerous tasks a law enforcement officer needs to deal with. This program is unpaid but does provide for course credit.  To apply for UIC Police’s Internship program first determine if you will be applying through LAS Internship or CLJ Internship.  If you are going to apply in LAS then contact Lauren Gallagher, Assistant Director for Career Development and Internships, at laureng4@uic.edu she will instruct you on the program.  If you choose CLJ then you have to contact the CLJ department and apply with them first.  Once you have completed this step you can contact the Internship Coordinator, at uicpd@uic.edu he/she will email you the application forms and give you a date that they are due.  After all forms and applications are received there will be an interview date with all applicants.  Each semester we will accept 3 Interns to our program who will be notified by email that they have been selected for the semester.  For any questions or for more information contact the Policing And community Engagement (P.A.C.E) unit  at uicpd@uic.edu or at (312) 41 3-2354 .
