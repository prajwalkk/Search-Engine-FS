Join colleagues and friends at the Alumni & Friends Celebration , to ignite our shared passion for Jane Addams College of Social Work and celebrate individuals who have made significant contributions to the advancement of social justice.  The celebration kicks off with a reception, where you’ll enjoy live music, a smorgasbord of delectable hors d’oeuvres, and a wine and beer bar, as you catch up with old friends and make new acquaintances.  Then we’ll gather for coffee, dessert and an inspiring program featuring remarks from Congressman Danny K. Davis, recipient of the Social Justice Ally Award, and the presentation of the Jane Addams Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award and the Jane Addams Rising Alumni Award.       Guest Speaker and Jane Addams Social Justice Ally Award      Honorable Danny K. Davis, Member of Congress, 7th District . Congressman Davis has distinguished himself as an articulate voice for his constituents and as an effective legislator able to move major bills to passage. He has developed a unique and energetic style of communication and interaction with his constituents setting up dozens of advisory task forces to consider significant questions of public policy.  He hosts several weekly television and radio shows which feature audience call in and produces regular written reports to every household in the district. In addition, he maintains weekly office hours in the district and is widely sought after as a speaker at conferences and events.  In the 116th Congress, Representative Davis is resolutely committed to preserving our democracy, protecting social security, maintaining our nation’s gains in civil and human rights, women’s rights, voting rights, protection of the environment, consumer and labor protections, reducing inequality, and ensuring quality, affordable health care for all, while maintaining his long-time focus on issues of job creation, poverty, health care, education, youth and criminal justice reform.       Jane Addams Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award      Maureen Rigney, MSW ’94 , has been with the organization now known as GO2 Foundation for Lung Cancer since 2004.

She has a special interest in lung cancer stigma and has collaborated on a number of stigma studies, many of which are published and all of which have been presented at national and international conferences.  GO2 Foundation has also given Maureen the opportunity advocate for issues at the macro-level, through presenting at Congressional Briefings and guiding advocates on Capitol Hill visits with their elected representatives. She represents GO2 Foundation and the lung cancer community on a variety of boards and committees, including the Global Lung Cancer Coalition. She is a member of the Association of Oncology Social Workers and serves on their advocacy committee.       Jane Addams Rising Alumni Award      Lissette Lucero Lopez, LCSW, CADC, MSW ’14 , has worked at Cook County Jail for six years, where she has applied her clinical skills and her passion for justice in working with incarcerated women, providing needed services and structure within the jail, and reducing recidivism within the community.  In 2019, Lissette was promoted to the role of Clinical Program Manager of a women’s residential substance use treatment program, working with detainees who are pregnant and establishing contact visits between incarcerated mothers and their children. The program was originally run by a contract agency, but under her management has developed into a source of genuine treatment and support for women caught between criminal activity and drug addiction.       5-Year Graduation Anniversaries   Additionally, there will be special recognition for alumni with these 5-year graduation anniversaries: 1970, 1975, 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 or 2015.

Alumni Peer-to-Peer Consultation Group   The college is a announcing a new opportunity for our hard-working Jane Addams professionals: quarterly peer-to-peer consultation group meetings.  The intention of the meetings is to provide a welcoming, open format for social workers to reconnect with fellow grads and network with other Chicago social work professionals. The meetings will begin with introductions followed by open sharing that can include discussion of common clinical issues, case presentations and sharing of resource information with the group. We want to provide a safe and comfortable forum for both practical and emotional support with other Jane Addams graduates.  Questions?
