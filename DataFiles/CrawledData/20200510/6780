The Summer Session Only application is intended for students who want to enroll in undergraduate-level courses for credit during the summer but do not intend to continue their undergraduate studies at UIC in the fall. All visiting students must apply and be admitted nondegree for the summer term only before they can register for courses.  The Summer Session Only application is only valid for enrollment in Summer Session 2020. If you wish to continue your enrollment beyond summer, check the Office of Admissions instructions on how to apply as a degree-seeking student .   Visiting Student Categories  Select the category below that best describes you for specific application instructions.   I’m a UIUC/UIS student.   + I’m an undergraduate at another university.  Students interested in taking undergraduate-level courses at UIC for the summer only apply as Summer Session Only students. If you are currently attending another college or university, you must be in good standing at that institution.  You do not need to submit additional documentation (UIC does not require transcripts) – simply submit the Summer Session Only application by the application deadline .    + I’m starting/applying at UIC in the fall.  If you have already applied or been admitted to UIC in the upcoming fall semester as a first year, transfer, or graduate student , but want to take undergraduate courses during the preceding summer, you will need to fill out the Summer Session Only application by the  application deadline . If you still plan to apply as a degree-seeking student for the fall, visit the Office of Admissions for more information.  Note for fall admitted incoming students: Even if you attend Summer Session, you will still need to submit your Intent to Enroll  for the fall semester by the Intent to Enroll deadline. Also, Summer Session Only students are admitted with a nondegree status so once you’ve completed your summer course(s), you’ll need to petition your college to transfer the credits into your degree program. If you have questions about which course to take in summer, consult a UIC advisor.    + I’m an international student.  Check our special instructions for international applicants for application information.    + I already have an undergraduate degree.  If you already have an undergraduate degree but want to take undergraduate courses in preparation for applying to professional degree programs, you can apply as a Summer Session Only student by the  application deadline .    + I’m a graduating high school senior.
