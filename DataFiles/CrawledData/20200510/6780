Please note: We’re monitoring the Coronavirus situation as it relates to Summer Session and will be following campus guidelines in the coming weeks. Check here for COVID-19 related updates .  Current UIC students  If you’re a currently enrolled student in good standing at UIC and will not be graduating before the summer, you are eligible to attend Summer Session. You do not have to apply to take summer courses; you register for summer courses at the same time as when you register for fall courses. Registration for 2020 summer courses begins April 15.  Graduating Seniors who want to take summer courses  If you are graduating prior to Summer Session and want to take undergraduate courses during the summer, you will need to apply as a Summer Session Only student . As a Summer Session Only student, you would be admitted to UIC as a nondegree undergraduate for the summer term only. Please note that this means, unlike your current status at UIC, you will be assessed the Summer Session Only tuition rates, you will not be eligible for financial aid, and you may have different registration requirements.  Since you are a current UIC student, you will have been assigned a Time Ticket during Advance Registration. However, you should wait until you have been admitted as a Summer Session Only student before you register for courses. If you mistakenly register for courses before you have been admitted, contact the Registration Helpline at (312) 996-8600 for assistance.         Have a question?
