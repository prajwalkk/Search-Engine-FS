The federal government and UIC fund the program. Students interested in FWS must request it on their financial aid notifications. Students offered FWS must secure jobs on their own, hourly wages vary. To search for a FWS job, visit the Office of Student Employment website .  FWS employees are paid by direct deposit every two weeks – funds do not go towards tuition charges with the University. FWS earnings are taxable income and must be reported when filing. On the following year’s FAFSA student can indicate the amount earned from FWS and it will be subtracted from their income without decreasing eligibility for financial aid.
