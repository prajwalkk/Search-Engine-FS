The University of Illinois at Chicago does not currently have an aerospace engineering major for undergraduate students, which makes the organization a great place to gain experience in that field. The AIAA chapter is separated into three main teams: Rocketry, Quadcopter, and Design Build Fly. Each of the team provides a hand-on experience in designing, prototyping, and constructing either high powered rockets, quadcopters, or controlled aircrafts.
