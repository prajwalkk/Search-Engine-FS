Registration/Course Approval  UIC REGISTRATION FOR YOUR TERM ABROAD  You will be registered as a full-time student (12 hours for a semester or 6 hours for summer) by the Study Abroad Office for a study abroad rubric depending on your college. If you will be receiving the MAP grant, you will automatically be registered for 15 credits to receive the full MAP grand award amount.  If you have already registered for UIC courses for the term you are supposed to be abroad, you must contact Maggie Miller at the Study Abroad Office for withdrawal instructions. The Study Abroad Office cannot register you for study abroad until you have resolved this issue.  HONORS COLLEGE STUDENTS  All Honors College students are responsible for registering themselves for Honors Activity HON222. Make sure to select the CRN that is tuition suppressed.  ACADEMIC/FINANCIAL HOLD ON YOUR UIC ACCOUNT  Please clear any outstanding holds on your UIC student account ASAP. The Study Abroad Office will not be able to register you your term abroad until your holds have been removed and your hold status remains clear. If you are not registered by the UIC Study Abroad Office, you cannot study abroad, and your Financial Aid will not be disbursed.  RETURN REGISTRATION  The Study Abroad Office will not register you for your return semester. You can register on-line through my.uic portal. Because you will be registering for your return semester before you actually do return, please be sure you have completed all the necessary academic advising before departure so that you may register for the classes you will need towards graduation.  COURSE APPROVAL  Your Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS) / college dean / basic language signatory, and/or college advisor, will be the final authority on the articulation of credit earned abroad. For this reason, you must have your courses approved before you go overseas. You should seek academic advising in both your major department and your college before going abroad. Any coursework you hope to take for your major or minor requirements must be authorized by the DUS or a designated signatory in the appropriate department. If there are any additions to be made to your Course Approval Form before your departure, please ask your Study Abroad Advisor for an additional Course Approval Form. The form must be submitted to the Study Abroad Office prior to departure.  Financial Aid  FINANCIAL AID FOR YOUR TERM ABROAD  If you plan on receiving financial aid (grants and/or loans), it is your responsibility to make the necessary arrangements prior to your departure.   Once you have selected a specific study abroad program, your SAO advisor will create a budget that will be sent to the Financial Aid Office. Students should make an appointment with the Study Abroad Office contact in Financial Aid, Hua Kao , to discuss the financial aid package possible for the term abroad.  Aid will be disbursed directly into the student’s account and students are responsible to use that money to pay their program provider directly. Disbursal timing is based on the student completing all the necessary Financial Aid paperwork on time.  You must fill out and return to Hua Kao the Study Abroad Agreement form . Without this form, your Financial Aid application will be considered incomplete!   Because Financial Aid applications sometimes require several months to process, it is to your advantage to begin as early as possible. For any financial aid questions, please contact Hua Kao , Study Abroad Financial Aid Advisor.  Health Insurance  INTERNATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE (AJG)  For the safety of its students, the University of Illinois requires that all students participating in study abroad programs have international study abroad insurance coverage.  Instructions to enroll in Arthur J Gallagher’s health insurance are on our website. Once you enrolled in AJG online , they will provide you with a confirmation email, insurance card, claim form, and policy. AJG does not cover students in their country of residence.  To be exempted from purchasing the University of Illinois AJG insurance, you must have had your personal insurance company or companies complete and sign the Petition for Exemption from the University of Illinois AJG Insurance, stating that your international coverage is comparable to that of AJG. This form must be submitted to the Study Abroad Office three weeks prior to the first Pre-departure Orientation. No exemption will be allowed without a completed and signed Petition. The UIC Study Abroad Office strongly recommends that you extend your insurance coverage during any stay prior to the beginning of or after the end of your program. You may purchase insurance from AJG or another company. If you choose AJG for additional coverage, it would be a separate policy, and you must contact AJG directly to arrange for the purchase of this extended coverage. More information is available on the AJG website .  CampusCare  All registered students are automatically enrolled in CampusCare while studying abroad at UIC unless they have previously opted out. International Health Insurance (AJG) does not replace CampusCare or other domestic policies.  For questions or clarification contact CampusCare at 312-996-0019. US Department of State Travel Registration We strongly recommend that you register your trip abroad with the U.S. Department of State using their Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP). Travel registration is a free service provided by the U.S. Government to U.S. citizens who are traveling to or living in, a foreign country. Registration allows you to record information about your upcoming time abroad that the Department of State can use to assist you in case of an emergency.  Differences Abroad There are many differences you will find abroad. Please review these resources on local laws connected with Drugs Abroad and Differences in Academic Systems .  Immunizations Your Study Abroad program may notify you if any specific immunizations are required or recommended for the country where you will be studying. Students are also encouraged to contact the UIC Travel Clinic at (312) 996-7420 for a country-specific travel consultation appointment. If you do not want an in-person appointment, you can email Irene Stasula . In addition, all students should check with their own physician to learn of any shots that may be recommended or required for them. Other resources include The U.S. State Department’s Overseas Citizens Emergency Center , the World Health Organization in Washington, DC., or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.  Important Things to Remember The UIC Study Abroad Office CAN assist you before your departure if you have questions about Study Abroad courses, financial aid, registration, billing, or anything important regarding your Study Abroad program. However, once you are abroad, please contact the appropriate parties and copy your Study Abroad Advisor on any email correspondence. We CANNOT pay bills, encumbrances, or tuition for you. Please pay all your bills before you go. Also, if the Office of Admissions and Records does not have your permanent address , please contact them at 312-996-4350 before you leave. We CANNOT register you for your return term. You can register through my.UIC portal. We CANNOT do your debt management or academic advising. Make sure you have completed all the necessary paperwork so that for your return, you may register for the classes you’ll need towards graduation. We CANNOT change your major while you are abroad. We CAN answer your emails, faxes, and Skype calls. Any correspondence relevant to your college or financial aid status must be addressed directly to the appropriate office using your official UIC email address. However, in an emergency, you may contact us by calling our emergency line at  (+1-312) 636-4150.
