In compliance with state law and university policy, the Office of the Dean of Students maintains Student Disciplinary Records for a period of seven (7) years from the date of the final decision or resolution. Files are maintained permanently for all pending incidents and incidents resulting in suspension, dismissal, or expulsion. For more information, please refer to the UIC Student Records Policy.       Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA)   The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. In order for a third party (e.g. parent, spouse, lawyer, etc.) to access a student’s disciplinary record, the student must complete the Consent to Release Records form. Through this form , students will choose which of their education records they wish to be shared and with whom.       Transcripts vs Student Disciplinary Records   The Student Disciplinary Records maintained by the Office of the Dean of Students are separate from a student’s transcript, which is maintained by the Office of the Registrar. A Student Disciplinary Record consists of any conduct proceedings where the student was found responsible for a violation of the Student Disciplinary Policy. A student’s transcript is a reflection of their academic record, including such items as credit hours taken, grades and grade point average. If a student is dismissed or expelled from the University for disciplinary reasons, there will be a permanent notation of the dismissal or expulsion on the student’s transcript. If a student is suspended from the University for disciplinary reasons, there will be a notation of the sanction on the student’s transcript during the period of suspension.  Please visit the Dean’s Certification page for information on verifying a disciplinary record.
