UIC bioengineering students choose among four concentrations:  Bioinformatics Brings together computer science, statistics, and molecular biology to explain how genetics directly affect the function of all living things.  Biomedical Imaging Provides ways to see inside the human body: enhancing current methods, such as magnetic resonance, ultrasound, and nuclear imaging, as well as exploring the cutting edge.  Cell and Tissue Engineering Creates and grows biological structures that can restore human function, such as insulin production, or stimulate the body to repair injuries by regenerating itself.  Neural Engineering Uses artificial bioelectric interfaces to create neuro-prosthetic devices such as cochlear implants, which are in use today, and a silicon retina, which is being developed.       Career Paths in Bioengineering   At UIC Bioengineering, our experts in   Bioinformatics  Biomaterials  Biomechanics  Biomedical Imaging  Biomolecular Engineering  Cell and Tissue Engineering  Computational Modeling  Human Augmentation  Human Microbiome  Metabolic Modeling  Nanotechnology  Neural Engineering  Rehabilitation  Systems Biology   Will prepare you for careers in   Medtech/Biotech R&D  Medtech/Biotech Entrepreneurship  Medicine  Dentistry  Patent Law  Health Policy  And much more.   The Engineering Career Center helps UIC undergraduates to chart their course in these and other fields.  Learn more about undergraduate study in bioengineering at UIC.
