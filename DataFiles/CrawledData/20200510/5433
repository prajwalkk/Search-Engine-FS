This includes the Annual Safety Report (ASR) and a Daily Crime Log.  Under the Clery Act, schools must disclose incidents that occur on campus, on property owned or controlled by the school, and on public property surrounding the campus. In reporting, schools report four categories of crime statistics including Criminal Offenses, Hate Crimes, Violence Against Women Act offenses, and Arrests and Referrals for Disciplinary Action.
