Action (Get Out!)   On an annual basis, familiarize yourself with emergency stairwells, exit routes, and the designated Evacuation Assembly Area for your primary building, as well as for all buildings that you frequent. Review section to the “Floor Coordinators” for more information. Evacuations are mandatory for fire alarms and when directed by authorities. No Exceptions!  Signals: A building evacuation will be signaled by the building fire alarm, including strobe lights, audible alerts, and/or other means of emergency notification (e.g., UIC ALERT or other notifications by first response agencies).      How to prepare for a Building Evacuation         How to Prepare for a Building Evacuation   When you receive an emergency notification, leave the building and proceed to the Evacuation Assembly Area as identified on the building’s evacuation map.   Evacuate the building as quickly as possible using the primary or alternate exit routes. If someone is injured or unable to evacuate, dial (312) 355-5555 or 911 and be prepared to give the exact location of the emergency, including the building address, building name, and cause of the emergency.  ­Assess your situation; if you observe evidence of fire (fire or smoke), pull the manual fire alarm to prompt a response for others to evacuate.  ­If time permits and these operations can be performed safely:  ­Turn off­ equipment and secure hazardous materials.  ­Take critical personal items only.  Assist those who need help, but carefully consider whether you may put yourself at risk.  ­Look for exit signals indicating potential egress/escape routes.  ­If you are not able to evacuate, go to the designated Area of Rescue Assistance or nearest stairwell if you can.  ­Evacuate to the Evacuation Assembly Area and remain there until additional instructions are given.  ­Alert authorities to those who may need assistance or any missing or trapped persons.  ­DO NOT use elevators.  ­DO NOT reenter the building until authorized emergency personnel give the “all clear” signal.         If you get caught in smoke         If You Get Caught in Smoke    ­Stay low; smoke will rise to ceiling level ­first.  ­If you encounter smoke when escaping, crawl or get as low as you can until you enter a clear area or are outside. The cleanest air will be within one to two feet off the floor.  ­Hold your breath as much as possible; breathe through your nose and use a ­filter such as a shirt, towel, or handkerchief.  ­Be aware of your surroundings. Take note of and follow EXIT signs.   Stay where you are until cleared to exit or reenter the building by emergency personnel or UIC ALERT!
