With a deliberate balance of the practical and the visionary, our programs celebrate the expertise of design making and emphasize the role of skilled designers in the strategic realm of design thinking.  The School of Design offers the Bachelor of Design in two areas: Graphic Design and Industrial Design. Grounded in traditions of studio-based instruction, UIC Design programs are organized to reflect and advance rapid developments in the field. Design practice in the 21st century encompasses a growing spectrum of activities that range from the craft traditions of design making to the leadership skills of design thinking. UIC Design students are taught fundamental skills in an exciting and rigorous sequence of studio courses; they learn about the history and progress of design in the present, past, and future; they participate in research activities that provide context and meaning for their work; and they are guided in the development of advanced applications and expressions of their ideas.  The setting of a public urban research university with a mission of engaged research is ideal for the study of design. In many instances ideas that begin in UIC Design classrooms extend beyond the walls of the university to bring about positive change for real world concerns. The academic rigor of the UIC programs is recognized by design-savvy employers in Chicago and beyond.
