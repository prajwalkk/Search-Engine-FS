Our faculty are leaders in professional organizations and serve on national research and professional boards, such as the Scientific Review Sections for the National Institutes of Health, the National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties, and the Board of Scientific Advisors of the National Cancer Institute. Faculty and student scholars conduct life-changing research in areas such as:   Health promotion and disease prevention  Symptom measurement, management, and quality of life  End of life and palliative care  Innovations in health information technologies  Health disparities and health equity  Neurobiology of sleep and sleep disorders  Discovering biologic mechanisms and markers  Developing interventions to help improve or adapt/manage diverse health disorders   Academic Programs  Leading the way in Illinois in educating adult-gerontology primary and acute care nurse practitioners, our programs offer a diverse curriculum to provide care to the entire adult/older adult age spectrum and across the continuum of care from wellness to illness. The scope of practice of the adult-gerontology primary care nurse practitioner (AG-PCNP) or adult-gerontology acute care nurse practitioner (AG-ACNP) is not setting-specific but patient-centered.  The objectives of our Doctor of Nursing Practice programs are to prepare expert advanced practice nurses who can synthesize practice, research, and theory to increase the quality and utilize evidence as the basis of patient care.      Our department is home to these DNP programs:        Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner          Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner           Info for current and future preceptors       About our academic programs           Meet the interim department head      Laurie Quinn, PhD, RN, FAAN, FAHA, CDE APN-CS  Clinical Professor  Laurie Quinn, a clinical professor in the Department of Biobehavioral Health Science, has been a researcher for more than 20 years.
