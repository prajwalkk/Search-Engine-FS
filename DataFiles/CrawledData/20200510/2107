This first-year experience and professional development course is designed to help students successfully transition from high school to a university environment as well as teach professional development skills needed for leadership. BA 100 includes an introduction to study strategies and techniques as well as an orientation to resources available at UIC. Students will be given an overview of the CBA degree programs and careers in business. Additionally, this course provides ample opportunities to connect with other students, faculty, staff, and organizations and activities on campus. In their second year, students must successfully complete BA 220 . BA 220 is to be taken in students’ fourth semester and is intended to develop “professional presence”—the verbal and nonverbal skills necessary to excel professionally. In either semester of their third year, students must successfully complete BA 320 . The primary goal of BA 320 is to understand and practice the value of serving the community. A secondary goal of the class is to learn and practice building effective teams.  BA 100 , BA 220 , and BA 320 are one-semester-hour courses required for graduation. The hours count in the calculation of tuition, full- or part-time enrollment status, and financial aid eligibility. However, the hours do not count towards the 120 hours necessary to graduate.  Foreign Language Requirement  The College of Business Administration requires at least two years of a single foreign language in high school with minimum grades of C as a criterion for admission. Students who are admitted with a deficiency in this area must take two semesters of a single foreign language at the college level with minimum grades of C or prove proficiency in a foreign language.  General Education Core  General Education at UIC is designed to serve as a foundation for lifelong learning. Students are required to complete a minimum of 24 semester hours in the General Education Core with at least one course from each of the following categories:   Analyzing the Natural World  Understanding the Individual and Society  Understanding the Past  Understanding the Creative Arts  Exploring World Cultures  Understanding U.S. Society   For a description and a list of courses for each General Education Core category, students should consult the General Education section of the catalog. Information on meeting the General Education requirements for each College of Business Administration degree program is detailed in the previous section on General Course Requirements.  General Education Proficiencies—University Writing Requirement  A minimum grade of C in ENGL 160 and ENGL 161 is a degree requirement. Transfer students who have taken the equivalent of ENGL 160 and/or ENGL 161 at other institutions may only receive graduation credit for these courses if they earned minimum grades of C.  Mathematics Requirements  Business students must register for a mathematics course every semester beginning with their first semester of enrollment until one of the required mathematics tracks has been completed. After completing the required math courses, students must enroll in Business Statistics ( IDS 270 ). Some students may be required to take prerequisite math courses prior to enrolling in the required math courses.

Students may place anywhere in this sequence  Other Requirements  Course Work Limitations  Courses that duplicate previous course work do not count toward graduation, nor do courses in which failing grades are received. Furthermore, credit earned in the following courses does not count towards graduation:   Course List         Code  Title  Hours     Courses  BA 100 Introduction to UIC and Professional Development  BA 220 Business Professional Development II  BA 289 Business Internship Program  BA 320 Civic Engagement  ENGL 070 Introduction to Academic Writing for the Nonnative Speakers of English  ENGL 071 Introduction to Academic Writing  MATH 090 Intermediate Algebra  MATH 118 Mathematical Reasoning  MATH 121 Precalculus Mathematics  MATH 140 Arithmetic and Algebraic Structures  MATH 141 Algebraic and Geometric Structures  Kinesiology courses. Kinesiology courses that are approved for General Education requirements are accepted.  Foreign Language courses taken to fulfill a deficiency in the CBA foreign language additional graduation requirement will not be counted in the total degree hours needed for graduation. Students who take foreign language courses that do not fall into the foreign language requirement category can use these courses to fulfill general elective credit requirements.  English as a Second Language courses (CC 050 and CC 060)    The only exception is that students may earn 3 semester hours of credit in ENGL 070 or ENGL 071 and a waiver of ENGL 160 if written authorization is received from the Department of English. BA 100 , BA 200 , BA 289 , BA 320 , ESL courses, MATH 090 , and Academic Skills Program courses do not carry academic credit and will not be used in computing the grade point average, but will be used for the purpose of determining full- or part-time status, and for financial aid eligibility.  Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement  In addition to meeting all University requirements for the degree, students must earn a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00/4.00 in each of the following to qualify for graduation:   all courses taken at the University of Illinois at Chicago  all courses (UIC and transfer) counted toward the degree and  in the major.   Graduation Declaration/Filing to Graduate/Degree Completion  The College of Business Administration is dedicated to assisting students with the achievement of both their academic and professional goals in a timely manner. One semester before graduation, CBA students are required to meet with their academic advisor to complete a graduation review. In the semester of graduation, students will receive a graduation check via their UIC email account verifying they are cleared to graduate. When students register for their final semester of courses, they will also declare their intent to graduate online using Student Self-Service. The deadline to declare graduation in the my.UIC system is the end of the third week (fall and spring) or second week (Summer Session 2) of the term in which graduation is sought. Failure to complete these two steps may delay the awarding of the degree to the next semester. A final review of the records will be made following the close of the term.  Students completing all degree requirements for their declared major will need permission from their college to enroll in additional undergraduate courses. See the University Degree Requirements section of the catalog for a complete description of this policy.  Enrollment Residence Requirement  The following college enrollment residence requirements apply to all CBA students:   At a minimum, 60 semester hours are required at the University of Illinois at Chicago or any other accredited four-year college or university. The enrollment residence requirements must also be met. Thus, students ordinarily should not register at a community college after completing the sophomore year.  The last 30 hours of course work must be taken in enrollment residence at UIC.  At least two-thirds of the credit required for a departmental major must be completed at UIC.  Concurrent attendance at the University of Illinois at Chicago and another collegiate institution or enrollment during the summer at another institution, when approved by the student’s college, does not interrupt the UIC or CBA enrollment residence requirement for graduation.   Ethics Requirement  All students are required to demonstrate understanding of business ethics through completion of an online ethics examination or by taking an ethics course offered in the CBA.  Assessment Requirement  To ensure the quality of the academic program and to assist in continuous improvement efforts, all students must participate in one assessment event prior to graduation. Students will register for a non-credit course ( BA 395 ) to complete this requirement.  Computer Requirement  Business students are required to have a laptop computer that can run the latest versions of Microsoft Windows and Office and has Wi-Fi or wireless Internet access.  College Policies  Academic Load  To be considered a full-time student during the fall and spring semesters, a student must be registered for a minimum of 12 semester hours. For Summer Session 1 (Four-Week) and Summer Session 2 (Eight-Week), UIC considers a total aggregate of 6 semester hours as the minimum number necessary to constitute full-time enrollment. A maximum of 18 semester hours may be taken in a semester (12 hours between the two summer sessions). To complete a CBA degree within four years, a student must take an average course load of 15–16 hours per semester. Students requiring prerequisite math or English courses should plan to attend summer school to ensure timely graduation and meet this goal. For each hour of registered course work, students should expect to complete three hours of homework, studying, and reading.  Academic Probation and Dismissal Rules  Students’ academic status will be based on their semester or cumulative grade point average. Students are in “good standing,” “on probation,” or “dismissed.” Students can check their academic status after each semester on my.UIC . Students who are on academic probation or who have been dismissed are informed of their status by UIC email from the college following the end of the semester.  Probation Rules  Students will be placed on academic probation in any term in which they earn either a cumulative or semester grade point average of less than 2.00/4.00. They will then be expected to earn at least a 2.00/4.00 semester grade point average and to raise their cumulative grade point average to a 2.00/4.00 to achieve good academic standing.  Academic probation at UIC can only be removed by successfully completing additional course work at UIC. Probation is broken down as follows.   UG Probation Rules     Probation Level  Conditions  Consequences  Remedy     Semester Probation  Semester GPA is below 2.00/4.00, but the UIC cumulative GPA is 2.00 or higher  Warning status is assigned.  Must meet with an advisor to discuss academic difficulties and seek tutoring, if necessary.   Academic Probation  UIC cumulative GPA is below 2.00/4.00  Academic restrictions enforced until required GPA level is achieved.  Must meet with an advisor to discuss their academic progress, sign an academic contract, and seek tutoring in difficult subjects. Students are required to meet with an academic advisor three times each semester until they are no longer on probation.   Dismissed  UIC cumulative GPA is considerably below 2.00/4.00  Student is dismissed from the university.  Student will not be allowed to register for classes at UIC.     The following rules are applied to determine the academic status of a student on probation:   A student in good academic standing is placed on semester probation for any semester in which less than a 2.00/4.00 GPA is earned, but the UIC cumulative GPA is 2.00 or higher (Warning Status).  A student in good academic standing is placed on academic probation in any semester in which the UIC cumulative GPA falls below a 2.00/4.00.  A student currently on academic probation is continued on academic probation (unless dismissed from the university) until both the cumulative GPA and the UIC GPA are raised to 2.00/4.00.   CBA Undergraduate Programs determines the conditions of probation. In addition to specifying the grade point average, the college may require the completion of specific courses, limit the number of hours for which students register, and exclude students from taking certain courses while on probation.  All students on probation are required to adhere to the following terms of probation (academic restrictions). Failure to do so will result in registration holds and possible academic dismissal.   Students must meet with their academic advisor to complete an academic contract. The contract will include any requirements and/or restrictions for the student’s next semester.  Students must schedule an appointment with their CBA academic advisor two additional times during the semester to discuss their academic progress for the term.  Students cannot register for more than 12 hours of course work for the semester (6 hours during the summer term).  Students must seek tutoring in their weak subject areas, i.e. math, accounting, economics, statistics, etc. Tutoring is available in the College of Business Administration Business Learning Center during the fall, spring, and summer semesters, the Honors College, the Writing Center, and the Mathematical Science Learning Center, as well as many other support programs on campus.   Dismissal Rules   If a student is on academic probation, the student may be dismissed in any term in which he/she fails to meet the grade point average required by the probation status and in which the cumulative grade point average in courses taken at UIC is less than 2.00/4.00.  If a student is on academic probation, the student may be dismissed in any term in which he/she fails to meet the grade point average required by the probation and in which the combined transfer and UIC grade point average is less than 2.00/4.00.  If the student fails to make any significant progress toward a degree, the student may be dismissed from the college, and is therefore ineligible to enroll at the university in subsequent semesters.  The student may be dismissed in any term in which he or she fails to comply with the conditions set by the College of Business Administration.   Change of Course Schedule—Dropping Courses  Undergraduate students may drop courses using my.UIC through the end of the second week of classes for fall and spring semesters, the first Wednesday of Summer Session 1, or the first Friday of Summer Session 2. During weeks 3 through 10 of the fall and spring semesters (first Thursday through the second Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or weeks 2 through 5 of Summer Session 2), students may drop courses with the permission of their major college. If the drop occurs between 0 and 2 weeks in fall and spring, there will be no notation on the transcript. If the drop occurs during weeks 3 through 10 in fall and spring (first Thursday through the second Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or weeks 2 through 5 of Summer Session 2), a W is noted on the transcript. Undergraduate students may drop a maximum of 4 UIC individual courses that result in a W notation on their transcript during their entire undergraduate degree program.  To avoid difficulty, CBA suggests that students do the following:   Meet with a CBA academic advisor each semester to plan a manageable course schedule and stay on track for graduation.  Get feedback from their instructors before the drop deadline to determine if they are succeeding in their classes.  Give careful consideration before using this option early in their academic career.   Change of Major/Declaring a Major  Students are encouraged to discuss their options for majors within the College of Business Administration with faculty, career advisors, and academic advisors. CBA students must declare a major by the end of their sophomore year. Declaring or changing a major is done by making an appointment with an academic advisor.  Class Attendance  CBA’s expectation is that students will attend all classes because it is necessary for achieving academic success. Each instructor may establish specific attendance requirements for his/her course. The instructor is responsible for making the attendance policy clear to the students. An instructor cannot drop a student from a course due to nonattendance. It is the student’s responsibility to make certain that all courses are added and dropped properly by the published deadlines.  Closed Courses  Courses close because a maximum enrollment capacity is placed on each course. This limit cannot be exceeded due to fire code, safety and environmental regulations. It is necessary that students register at their assigned time to ensure the preferred course schedule.  College Level Examination Program (CLEP)  UIC awards credit on the basis of scores earned on the College Level Examination Program (CLEP). When seeking credit for a CLEP exam taken at another institution, a student's official score will be evaluated on UIC's credit-granting policy.  CLEP credit will not count toward general education credit, university writing, quantitative reasoning, foreign language, residency, major, or minor requirements. A student cannot take a CLEP exam in a subect in which they have earned credit. Three elective credit hours will be awarded per exam. A maximum of 30 credit hours is allowed.  The full list of CLEP exams available is available online. The Office of Testing Services administers CLEP exams on campus and can be reached at (312) 996-0919 for further information on CLEP examinations.  Course Prerequisites  Students must meet all course prerequisites. The most up-to-date prerequisites for courses are listed on my.UIC . Prerequisites are put on courses to ensure students’ success in the course and to maximize understanding and comprehension of the academic material. Students who do not meet published prerequisites may be dropped from the course.  Credit/No Credit Option  Students may elect to take courses on the credit/no credit option under the following conditions:   Students must be on clear academic status, not on academic probation;  Students must be enrolled full-time at UIC;  Only one course per semester may be taken on the credit/no credit option;  A maximum of 21 semester hours of credit/no credit course work can be earned at UIC. Courses that may not be taken on the credit/no credit option include:    Course List         Code  Title  Hours     Courses  ENGL 160 Academic Writing I: Writing in Academic and Public Contexts  ENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Writing for Inquiry and Research  BA 200 Managerial Communication  COMM 100 Fundamentals of Human Communication  ECON 120 Principles of Microeconomics  ECON 121 Principles of Macroeconomics  MATH 125 Elementary Linear Algebra  MATH 165 Calculus for Business  MATH 180 Calculus I  MATH 181 Calculus II  • Business Core courses  • Courses taken to satisfy a requirement of a particular major, i.e., the advanced quantitative skills requirement for Finance, and Information and Decision Sciences majors  • Major business courses  • Business elective courses  • Any accounting courses  • Any course a department or college stipulates as not eligible to be taken under the CR/NC option; this restriction should be listed on the course syllabus  • Minor courses    To elect this option, students must complete a Credit/No Credit Form in the CBA Undergraduate Programs office. The form must be submitted to 1118 UH by 4:15 p.m. (the close of business) on the tenth day of instruction (or the first Friday of Summer Session 1 or the second Friday of Summer Session 2). No exceptions will be made to this policy.  Double Major, Double Degrees, and Second Bachelor’s Degree  Double Major  Students pursuing a double major or dual major must submit a double major petition through Business Connect on the CBA website.  Dual Degrees  Students interested in pursuing a dual degree should submit a formal request via general petition to the undergraduate programs office. If a student’s request is approved, the College of Business Administration will serve as the primary college.  Second Bachelor’s Degree  Applicants who have already earned a bachelor’s degree must apply to the graduate program .  Graduate-Level Courses for Undergraduate Credit  The College of Business Administration prohibits undergraduate students from registering for graduate-level courses and the use of graduate-level credit applied toward the undergraduate degree. Students should understand that graduate-level courses taken by an undergraduate student are not applicable toward a future graduate or professional degree.  Independent Study  Students are required to contact an instructor in their major field of study to propose a topic for independent study. If approved, a Request for Independent Study Form must be completed and approved by the academic department before registering for an independent study course. In addition, if the course is to be applied toward the major, a formal petition must be approved by the department head and the Undergraduate Programs Office of the college. Students should consult the department office for specific procedures regarding enrollment in independent study courses.  Petition Procedure  Students who want to make formal requests or appeal college policies do so by using a petition process. CBA has various types of petitions available for different types of appeals, requests, or clarifications of policies and requirements. Petition forms and advice for completing these forms are available in the Undergraduate Programs Office in 1111 UH or on the CBA website.  Proficiency Examinations  Students interested in earning proficiency credit should contact the department for information concerning eligibility and availability of a proficiency exam. This is subject to the university, college, and departmental policy on proficiency examinations. Proficiency credit cannot be earned by CBA students for major-level courses, nor can proficiency credit earned for a foreign language be used towards the degree. A student who earns proficiency credit is given the amount of credit toward graduation regularly allowed in the course. Proficiency credit is not considered an interruption of the enrollment residence requirement, nor a satisfaction of the last 30-semester-hour enrollment residence requirement for graduation.  Required Advising for Registration Approval  Each semester, all Accounting majors, who have started taking major-level accounting courses, are required to meet with an academic advisor and an assigned faculty advisor in their major department prior to receiving approval to register. Students on academic probation must also meet with an academic advisor prior to registering for the next semester. Registration holds will not be removed from the student’s account until these conditions have been met.  Repeat Policy for Standard Graded Courses  Students may repeat a course to increase their knowledge of the subject matter. There are circumstances under which repeating a course is advisable and to a student’s advantage. There are also circumstances where repeating a course may disadvantage a student and narrow a student’s options. The College of Business Administration requires students to discuss any plan to repeat a course with their academic advisor before they register to repeat the course.  Courses with A, B, or C grades may not be repeated. Courses with D or F grades may be repeated once without written permissions. In all cases, the original grade for the course and the grade for each repeat will appear on the transcript . The original grade and the grade for each repeat will be calculated into the grade point average.  Only one registration for the course counts toward the total number of credits required for graduation. A course cannot be repeated after receiving credit in a course for which the repeat course is a prerequisite.  To repeat a course more than once requires written permission from the academic department head from which the course is being offered. Students who have been dismissed may not appeal on the grounds of intention to repeat courses. Certain courses may not be repeated; students should always consult their CBA academic advisor before repeating a course.  Undergraduate Grade Point Average Recalculation/Grade Exclusion Policy  The College of Business Administration may elect to implement this policy as early as the end of the junior year, or as late as the final semester during degree certification.  The college will evaluate each student unable to graduate because of an academic grade point average deficit. The deficit may occur in the UIC GPA, the program GPA, or both.  A student's academic record is examined so as to determine if courses, deemed appropriate by each college, with grades of F or grades of D, may be excluded from the student’s grade point average.  A total of four courses may be excluded, with one course excluded at a time until the necessary quality points are obtained to meet the UIC GPA requirement and/or degree program minimum GPA. The credit hours associated with excluded course grades will not count towards graduation requirements.   The college will initiate course exclusions, and only in consultation with the evaluated student.  This policy only applies to undergraduate degree-seeking students.  All courses taken and all grades will remain on the official transcript.  The grade exclusion policy does not apply to courses failed as the result of a student conduct hearing.  Grades earned from institutions other than UIC cannot be excluded.   CBA academic advisors and departments will have discretion in choosing courses that impact the student's major or degree program.  Effective Term: Fall, 2017  This policy will apply to all entering students for Fall 2017. Current and continuing students (who have entered prior to Fall 2017) are able to continue using the 2009 Grade Point Average Recalculation Policy until graduation or dismissal from the university.  The new proposed policy could be applied to any current or continuing student who has not utilized the 2009 Recalculation Policy.
