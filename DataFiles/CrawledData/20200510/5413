Under the provisions of chapter 110, section 305/7, Illinois Compiled Statutes 1992, members of the UIC Police Department are peace officers. University police have all the powers possessed by police in cities and by sheriffs, including the power to make arrests on view and on warrants of violations of state statutes and city or county ordinances.  We are a 24 hour/7 days a week operation whose main goal is to protect the lives and property of the University, its students and staff. UICPD is one of the largest non-municipal police departments that operates within the City of Chicago.
