The university expects students to follow the degree requirements and academic policies outlined in this publication. Students choose their degree programs, select and register for courses each term, and track their progress toward degree completion. In return, UIC provides students with a range of resources that are useful for academic planning, completing course requirements, and remaining on track for graduation. Many of these academic planning resources can be accessed online using the portal my.UIC .  Essential Online Resources for Students  Transferology  Transferology works in conjunction with uAchieve, the university degree audit system, to create transfer planning guides. Transferology planning guides assist prospective students by providing current information about how transfer credit is applied to specific UIC undergraduate degree programs. Students can create Transferology accounts through the Transferology website .  Current UIC students should contact their college advising office for information on transfer credit restrictions prior to enrolling in courses at other institutions.  uAchieve Degree Audit  uAchieve produces a degree audit intended for use within the university to facilitate advisement and to monitor progress toward undergraduate program completion. The degree audit identifies all components of the student’s chosen degree program, indicates how requirements have been met, and provides lists of approved courses from which the student may choose to fulfill remaining requirements.  Students should review a degree audit each semester through uAchieve and consult with an advisor each semester to select courses for the following semester. The uAchieve interface is accessed through the my.UIC portal on the Degree Audit tab.  Online Catalog and Course Descriptions  The 2019–2021 Undergraduate Catalog is online in html and PDF formats. The html version is updated regularly as degree programs, courses, and requirements change. The PDF version remains static as degree programs and requirements change.  Course descriptions are in the online catalog. The Schedule of Classes , a listing of courses for each term, can be accessed through my.UIC .  Planning for Academic Success  Planning for academic success begins early. To earn a degree from the University of Illinois at Chicago, students need to make thoughtful decisions about course selection each term; fulfill the degree requirements outlined by the university, college, and, if applicable, the department or school; and demonstrate competence in all courses according to university and college standards.  New students are often surprised by the transition to college academic life. For the first time, students are wholly responsible for their own success. Going to classes, doing the work, and understanding the concepts are up to the student. Selecting courses, meeting degree requirements, and following academic policies are the students’ responsibility. Asking questions, identifying problems, and seeking advice or help when necessary are a student’s prerogative. Students will find knowledgeable, caring faculty and advisors across campus ready to help with these and other concerns; all they have to do is ask.  Many first year students are undecided about a major. It is possible to be undecided and make progress toward a degree, but it requires careful planning with the help of an advisor. Similarly, a large number of students discover along the way that they would like to change majors. UIC offers a wide array of undergraduate degree programs to satisfy most academic interests. Students should discuss the options with an advisor before making a final decision. Advisors can help students identify degree programs of interest, entrance requirements, and degree requirements that have already been met.  Many students begin college with the goal of graduating in four years. To graduate in four years, students need to take at least 15 hours per semester. Whether or not a course load of 15 or more semester hours is manageable depends on several factors, including the difficulty of particular courses and degree programs, outside commitments like work and family, and individual learning styles. Academic advisors can help students set reasonable goals based upon individual circumstances. Before making the decision to extend graduation beyond four years, students should also meet with a financial aid counselor to discuss the impact of such a decision on the total cost of education and financial support.  Students should keep the following tips in mind as they plan for academic success:   Maintain files of relevant paper and electronic university correspondence, uAchieve degree audits, academic planning worksheets, and other important documentation pertaining to enrollment at UIC.  Meet with an advisor once a semester or more frequently as necessary.  Attend instructors’ office hours to ask questions about lecture material, course readings, and assignments.  Use the University Library system, including working with undergraduate librarians, to complete course requirements and build important research skills.  Take advantage of tutoring.  Go to every class.  Be realistic about academic goals.  Consider all the factors impacting a manageable course load as well as the four-year tuition guarantee and plan accordingly. For instance, plan on summer session courses if not taking a course load of 15 or more hours per semester.   Academic Advising  Academic Advising Mission Statement  The mission of academic advising at the University of Illinois at Chicago is to ensure successful undergraduate educational experiences. Academic advising is centered in the colleges. The larger advising network assists students with making the transition to college life and guides their informed decisions about the academic priorities, progress, and goals integral to completing degrees and preparing for careers.  Identifying the Advisor and Scheduling Appointments  Academic advisors are professional staff and faculty members who assist students with course selection, scheduling, degree requirements, administrative requirements, the interpretation of rules and regulations, and the utilization of campus resources. Academic advising is available to all UIC students. Academic advising at UIC is decentralized, which means that it occurs in the major college or department. Students can learn more about academic advising at UIC by visiting the Office for Advising Development's website .  Students should plan to meet with an academic advisor each term. The following guidelines are offered to help students make the most of advising appointments:   Schedule appointments well in advance of registration.  Examine degree requirements, course descriptions, and the Schedule of Classes prior to the advising appointment.  Develop a tentative schedule before meeting with an advisor.  Ask for clarification on issues pertaining to scheduling, degree requirements, course selection, academic policies, or anything else that may impact academic progress.  Review a uAchieve degree audit outlining progress toward the degree at each advising appointment.  Keep track of progress toward the degree and review records with the advisor. Advisors assist students with this process, but it is the students’ responsibility to make sure that all degree requirements are met.  Be aware of Change of Course Schedule (Drop/Add) rules and rules on Withdrawal from classes.  Stay informed of rules governing Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid , which may be found in the Financial Aid section of the catalog. Do not drop courses or withdraw without considering these rules and consulting a financial aid advisor if receiving financial aid.  Remember that advisors provide students with understanding and clarification of the options available, but students make their own decisions.  Make the best possible decisions by consulting the catalog, a uAchieve degree audit, and an advisor prior to course selection, registration, and enrollment.   Students should consult their college section of the catalog for specific information on academic advising through the college or department.  University Library  http://library.uic.edu  Richard J.

Harrison Street (2375 SSB) (312) 996-9099  summer@uic.edu  http://summer.uic.edu  The UIC Summer Session Office works to provide both current UIC and visiting students with timely information about the UIC summer sessions. Enrolling in summer courses is a good way for students to catch up or get ahead in their academic studies, or manage a heavy course load during the fall or spring. UIC offers students two summer sessions, Summer Session 1 (4-week session) followed by Summer Session 2 (8-week session). Students can enroll in courses in one or a combination of both. Although the summer sessions are shorter in length, all courses offered in the summer are worth the same number of semester hours as the same courses in the fall or spring. UIC students interested in taking advantage of summer session courses should discuss their plans with their college advisor.  Continuing UIC Students and Summer Session  Continuing UIC students register for summer in the same way as they do for fall or spring. In the spring, all eligible, continuing UIC students will be notified as to when they can view their Time Ticket online for summer and fall registration. The Time Ticket shows the earliest date and time that a student may register. As a general rule, undergraduate students may take up to 12 semester hours over the summer without special approval—either as a combination of courses taken in the 4-week and 8-week sessions, or just courses taken in the 8-week session.  Visiting Students and Summer Session  Visiting students who want to take undergraduate courses at UIC during the summer only and who do not intend to continue at UIC in the fall should apply using the Summer Session Only application. Please see the Summer Session website for further information on admission criteria and the application process. Summer Session Only students are admitted as nondegree students and are eligible to register for summer classes. Summer Session Only students may register online during Open Registration for summer, (check the Summer Session website for exact dates). As a general rule, Summer Session Only students may take up to 12 semester hours without special approval—either as a combination of courses taken in the 4-week and 8-week sessions, or just courses taken in the 8-week session.

Completion of the program leads to a commission in the U.S. Army. The Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) is open to all eligible full-time students, both male and female. A total of 32 semester hours of academic credit is available and is potentially applicable to graduation requirements as elective credit. The curriculum is centered on an applied leadership training program which is designed to develop personal traits and qualities essential to successful leadership in civilian life as well as the military environment.  ROTC basic courses are available to all students as an elective. Requirements for enrollment in the Advanced Course and to pursue a commission as an Army officer are as follows:   United States citizenship (legal residents may enroll in the Advanced Course, but must obtain citizenship prior to commissioning).  Full-time student in good academic standing.  Medically qualified for commissioning.  Physically fit enough to pass the Army Physical Fitness Test and Water Survival Test.   A student entering the university with successful completion of military training in high school at an accredited Junior ROTC program is entitled, upon enrollment, to higher placement as determined by the professor of military science. Instruction is offered through four-year and two-year programs. The four-year program consists of the Basic Course (first two years) and the Advanced Course (last two years). Cadets are issued, at no cost, uniforms and equipment necessary for the ROTC program.  Basic Course  The basic course, normally completed during the freshman and sophomore years, provides the student with a general knowledge of the military’s role in society and the missions of the Army. Subjects include leadership, land navigation, marksmanship, military history, and basic military skills. Students enroll in one military science course each semester. Additionally, a weekend field training exercise is required each semester. It is possible for a sophomore to complete the basic course in one year through prior arrangement with the department. The basic course consists of the first two years of Army ROTC classes including MILS 101 , MILS 102 , MILS 201 , and MILS 202 . Nonscholarship students who participate in or complete the basic program have no military service obligation.  Advanced Course  The advanced course is the professional phase of the ROTC program. Upon satisfactory completion of the required ROTC courses and the professional military education (PME) component, the student is eligible for a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the active Army, the Army National Guard, or the U.S. Army Reserve. The professional phase includes courses in leadership skills, training, personnel management, ethics, military justice, and military tactics. During the two years of the advanced course, students enroll in one military science course per semester.  Leadership Laboratory  Leadership laboratories are taught in conjunction with military science classes. The primary objective of leadership labs is to serve as a vehicle for leadership development. During leadership labs, MSIV and MSIII cadets perform respective supervisory roles as officers and noncommissioned officers (NCOs), while MSI and II cadets perform hands-on tasks that complement classroom instruction.  Financial Assistance and Scholarships  The ROTC Program offers financial assistance to qualified students in the form of tuition waivers, two-, three-, and four-year Army ROTC Scholarships, the Guaranteed Reserve Forces Scholarship, and the State of Illinois ROTC Scholarship Program. A $300 to $500 monthly stipend allowance is paid to all contracted cadets, depending upon their military science class.  Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) Program  Illinois Institute of Technology NROTC IIT 10 W. 35th Street Chicago, IL 60616 (312) 567-3530  nrotc@iit.edu  http://www.iit.edu/nrotc  Through the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) program, young men and women prepare for rewarding careers as officers in the United States Navy or the United States Marine Corps.  Midshipmen from the NROTC Chicago Consortium go on to have successful careers serving as officers in the Submarine, Surface Warfare, Naval Aviation, and Marine Corps communities after completion of their undergraduate program.  A national board selects scholarship program students from applications received as early as 18 months prior to a student's first semester or from those college program students (see below) specifically recommended by the Professor of Naval Science. For a period normally not exceeding four years, the Navy pays for all tuition, books, and fees, and provides an allowance of $250 to $400 per month. Graduates of the scholarship program receive a commission as Ensign, U.S. Navy, or Second Lieutenant, U.S. Marine Corps.  College Program students are nonscholarship students that participate in all naval science classes and activities throughout the school year. They compete annually for two- and three-year NROTC scholarships. UIC students enrolled in ROTC, who are also residents of Illinois, are eligible for state tuition waivers. Students who fail to earn a NROTC scholarship by their junior year may apply to continue in the NROTC program with “advanced standing.” Like scholarship recipients, College Program students with advanced standing receive commissions as Ensigns and Second Lieutenants in the Navy or Marine Corps upon completion of their undergraduate studies.  During summer break, students are assigned to naval ships, squadrons, or submarines where their education as future Navy and Marine Corps officers is enhanced by on-the-job training. Scholarship NROTC students attend summer training each year; students with advanced standing attend during the summer preceding their last academic year.  Naval science courses consist of both lecture and laboratory periods. Lecture and laboratory periods convene at Illinois Institute of Technology. Lecture days will vary depending on the course and lab is held each Thursday morning.  Students planning to enter NROTC in the fall semester are expected to attend a summer orientation program designed to acquaint them with military standards and traditions of the U.S. Navy. Students interested in attending this program should contact the NROTC office before July 1. For further information on NROTC, call the Department of Naval Science, (312) 567-8963 or visit the office on the 15th floor of Illinois Institute of Technology Tower, 10 W. 35th Street, Chicago IL 60616.

The UHP seeks to expand educational and research opportunities for these populations, at all academic levels (including precollege students), in order to develop underrepresented racial/ethnic minority healthcare professionals, faculty, and researchers with the goals of eliminating health disparities and advancing health equity. To fulfill its mission, the Urban Health Program provides the following services:   Comprehensive orientation to the health professions programs and to the UIC campus  Academic enrichment and career exploration opportunities for students as early as kindergarten  Conferences and seminars to expose students from junior high school through graduate and professional school to health careers and to important issues facing health professionals  Application and enrollment assistance  Individualized counseling, academic support, and mentoring  Links to UIC student support networks  Career planning and course selection  Networking opportunities among students, faculty, staff, community leaders, and healthcare professionals  Connections to outside organizations and practicing health professionals that often lead to scholarships, internships, field experiences, and mentoring relationships  Access to the UHP Resource Center and information and referrals service for students  Active engagement and commitment on behalf of our UHP alumni to help current students on the health professions trajectory   Since its establishment by Illinois legislative mandate in 1978, the Urban Health Program has played a direct role in the graduation of more than 6,000 Black, Latino and Native American students from the health professions colleges at UIC. As a result of the Urban Health Program’s efforts, UIC recruits and graduates more healthcare professionals of traditionally underserved heritage than any other college or university in the country. Partnering with elementary schools, high schools, student support programs, and other colleges and universities across Illinois, UHP is one of the only programs of its kind.

The Writing Center can be very busy towards the end of the semester, so students are encouraged to make their appointments in advance.
