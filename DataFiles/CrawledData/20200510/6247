Students Changing the Future Of Oral Health Through Research    Student Research Group         Multidisciplinary Oral Science Training (MOST) Summer Program  The MOST Summer Program provides unique research experiences to qualified undergraduate students. Participants work with faculty mentors to design and conduct a research project. Areas of research include: wound and tissue regeneration, developmental biology, bioengineering, biomaterials, cancer biology, microbiology and immunology. Students will also participate in regular seminars and other larger group activities, as well as prepare for presentation of their research. This is a 12 week program during the summer at the University of Illinois at Chicago, College of Dentistry for undergraduate students who are considering careers in biomedical or biological sciences and who are either US citizens or Permanent Residents, are encouraged to apply. Only students who will graduate during a semester after the summer of 2015 are eligible.  More about the MOST Summer Program    Clinic & Research Day   The College of Dentistry's annual Clinic and Research Day provides a forum for students, postgrads, and research staff to present research achievements to the members of the College and larger research community. Additionally, Research Day offers continuing education opportunities, dental products and service exhibits, a keynote lecture and student awards .   Also featured will be CaseCAT (Critically Appraised Topics) competitions, featuring actual cases that exemplify unique and interesting aspects of dental practice combined with critically appraised literature reviews relevant to those cases.  Features  Vendor exhibits will be located on the 4th and 5th floors throughout the day.  Visit the Kottemann Gallery of Dentistry and the DuBrul Archives Room.  Tour the clinics and laboratories.  Receive Continuing Education credit.  The 2016 event featured over 100 posters covering several topics:  Cancer Biology/Oral Cancer  Biomaterials/Dental Materials  Tooth Development & Movement  Social Science/Behavior  Wound Healing/Tissue Regeneration & Repair  Imaging &Therapeutic Modalities  Case Reports & Literature Reviews  More about Clinic & Research Day    Summer Research Program  Students who have been accepted into the DMD program may participate in a ten-week research experience prior to the fall semester. The program is designed for students to plan and perform a research project while receiving mentoring by selected leading research faculty.  Projects may fall within a range of disciplines, all relevant to the future practice of oral health care: biomaterials, mineralized tissue, tissue engineering, microbiology, immunology, wound healing, oral cancer, natural products, HIV, dental public health and oral health disparities. The Student Summer Research Program is the first formal opportunity for students to conduct research. It allows students to develop into clinicians who use evidence and critical thinking to advance their patients health. And it will eventually open pathways for translational research, connecting clinical practice with laboratory research, which will change the practice of dentistry.

Cooper, DDS, PhD Associate Dean for Research and Head of the Department of Oral Biology    Online Certificate in Clinical Research  UIC currently offers a fully online Clinical Research Methods (CRM) Certificate Program that is designed to fill the growing need for clinicians who would like to conduct clinically oriented research but are constrained by their limited research skills. It features a series of five online courses that provide a rigorous formal introduction to research methodology, evaluative methods, and statistical computing and data management. Completion of the program provides participants with the training needed to conduct clinical research and to collaborate with other clinician-scientists. Please contact the Office for Research if you have additional questions.        OSCI 399  Students who are enrolled as undergraduates at UIC and who wish to explore oral science during the academic year may enroll in OSCI 399 . The course is a mentored research experience and requires the prior approval of the faculty member. Interested students should visit the UIC Undergraduate Research Experience to identify and contact faculty who conduct oral science research.    Predental Undergraduate Research Forum  The forum is an opportunity for pre-dental undergraduate students who are conducting research to present it to students and faculty. The forum is held annually in April and organized by the College of Dentistry Student Research Group .

UIC is one of only seven Academic Health Centers in the country with a full complement of Health Sciences Colleges on a single campus (including medicine, pharmacy, dentistry, public health, nursing, allied health, and social work). Student and faculty investigators in UIC’s seven health sciences colleges work in an interdisciplinary research environment, with access to advanced research facilities, support for research design and data analysis, and a diverse patient population through the University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System . Learn more about Research at UIC .    Research at College of Dentistry  The College of Dentistry has a proud history of working across disciplines and leading breakthroughs in biological and biomaterials sciences to advance scientific knowledge and improve the health of our patients beyond the clinic. Students at UIC College of Dentistry work along side world-class faculty and staff from multiple disciplines to solve the biggest problems in oral sciences and impact lives beyond the clinic.   Craniofacial Pathology  Leading interdisciplinary investigations in the development and function of the craniofacial complex including processes that occur within cells and tissues to maintain health and control growth and development; understanding how alterations (genetic/environmental) result in disease (cancer) and study of microbiome/host interactions.      Regenerative Science  Moving beyond tissue replacement, using materials to enable our bodies to regenerate damaged and failing tissues. We are leading investigations into how materials interact with living tissues, and the building of tissue replacements for the growth of cells/tissues to replace lost tissues. The Center for Wound Healing and Tissue Regeneration (CWHTR) is a unique community of scientists and clinicians devoted to the study of injury, wound healing, and regeneration. The Laboratory of Applied Dental Biomaterials and Interfaces is a NIH funded center studying the properties of the tooth in order to develop reparative/regenerative biomaterials to replace lost tooth structure.      Clinical, Translational & Community  Leading transformative studies to improve oral health outcomes both in the clinic and the community. We have several centers and investigators focused on the study of the incidence and prevalence of disease; measuring outcomes of interventions; and safety and efficacy of drugs, devices, and treatments in individuals. We are also investigating how and why efforts to promote oral health through intervention are accepted by communities. The Oral Medicine and Pharmacognosy Research (OMPR) Laboratory focuses on medical anthropology and ethnopharmacology to study the non-destructive radiation in oral diagnostics and forensics. The Dental Medicine Responder Training (DMRT) is performing theory and policy research supporting dental professionals for emergency preparedness throughout the community.
