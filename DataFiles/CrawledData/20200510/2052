COVID-19 Updates and Resources         Breadcrumbs   Honors College    Admissions    Frequently Asked Questions        Frequently Asked Questions       FAQs     What is the Honors College?            We are a program at UIC that provides students with exceptional experiences both in the classroom and in their extra-curricular activities. The Honors College works with students across all undergraduate disciplines here at UIC to provide challenge and enrichment as they progress through their academic programs. We are different from what you may remember of Honors courses in high school in that we do not require our students to enroll in all Honors courses. The program encourages students to complement their Honors classroom experiences with undergraduate research, service, leadership, and culminates in a capstone experience in the final year.        What are some of the benefits to membership in the Honors College?            The Honors College supports high achieving students with Honors-specific resources and opportunities, including unique courses, a faculty mentor, a supportive community, honors housing, leadership opportunities, scholarships and additional funding opportunities (research, study abroad, and civic engagement), as well as holistic advising and support. Students who participate in the Honors College are more likely to graduate on-time. Nearly 60% of Honors College graduates go on to graduates or professional school.   First-to-second year retention = 94%  Four-year graduation rate = 71%; Six-year graduation rate = 84%         What are the requirements for admissions to the Honors College?            First Year: We do not have set requirements. The Honors College admissions process is holistic and includes review of the applicant’s test scores, high school transcripts, extracurricular interests and activities, written essays and letters of recommendation. To be considered for admission, students must first be admitted to one of UIC’s degree granting undergraduate programs.  Transfer: Successful applicants will have a minimum 3.40 UIC GPA and will need to complete the transfer application. To be considered for admission, students must first be admitted to one of UIC’s degree granting undergraduate programs.        What are the requirements to remain in the Honors College program?            Honors College students must maintain at least a minimum 3.40 UIC GPA and participate in Honors activities each semester at UIC. Honors activities begin to engage students in the classroom (honors core courses and seminars) and progressively take students into co-curricular activities (research/internships, leadership, and volunteer service). Each student in the Honors College is also required to complete an Honors capstone project which is the culmination of the student’s undergraduate study.        What kinds of scholarships are provided by the Honors College?            First Year: The Honors College offers an array of scholarships that range in value from $3,000 to full tuition plus room and board. Honors College scholarships are renewable for up to four years as long as the student remain a member in good standing of the UIC Honors College.  Transfer: Prior to starting at UIC, transfer students are able to apply for the Transfer Merit Award which covers the first semester of tuition. If the student was a member of Phi Theta Kappa at their previous institution, they are also welcome to apply to the Phi Theta Kappa Scholarship which covers tuition for the first semester of study at UIC. Students can apply to both opportunities but will only be able to receive one or the other.  The Honors College also provides funding opportunities to support undergraduate research, study abroad, and other student engagement and leadership experiences.        Are students required to stay on campus in Honors College housing? What are the housing options for Honors College students who do choose to stay on campus?            No, students do not have to stay in Honors College housing, and can choose whether or not to stay on campus. Many of our students who live on campus do live in Honors College living-learning communities. Honors Living-Learning communities are available in James Stukel Towers (JST) or the Academic and Residential Complex (ARC).        Is there an additional cost to being a part of the UIC Honors College at UIC?            No, there is no additional cost for being a member of the Honors College.        What about AP/IB/Dual Enrollment credits for students?            UIC accepts AP/IB/Dual Enrollment credits. There is a guide that is searchable on the UIC website that will assist you in figuring out specifically what scores are needed in which courses for AP/IB credits. Transferology can assist in determining how the dual enrollment courses will transfer into UIC courses. AP/IB/Dual enrollment credit does not exempt students from Honors College course requirements.        If I do not get accepted into the Honors College during the application process, can I apply later?            Yes. Current UIC students are able to apply to join the UIC Honors College as long as they meet the minimum 3.40 UIC GPA and have at least 4 semesters of undergraduate study left to complete. The Honors College accepts new students to the college for both Fall and Spring semesters.        If I do not get accepted into the Honors College during the application process, will that decision affect my UIC admissions decision?            No. If you are not admitted to the Honors College, it will have no bearing on your admission to the UIC college in which you originally applied. Students are first admitted to the UIC college in which they plan to study then subsequently the Honors College.        How do I apply to the Honors College?            The Honors College application is included in the Common Application for first-year applicants, and in UIC’s Transfer application. First-year students need to submit two letters of recommendation plus the Honors College essay. Transfer students need to complete the required essays.        I already applied to UIC, but did not complete the Honors College section of the application. Can I still apply?            Yes. Visit the Honors College website at honors.uic.edu for a link to a supplemental application that will collect the necessary information.        What are the deadlines to apply?            First Year: Priority deadline is November 1, 2019; Final deadline is February 1, 2020  Transfer: Spring 2020 deadline is December 1, 2019 ; Fall 2020 deadline is June 1, 2020        I already applied to the Honors College, when will I learn my decision?            For first year applicants who apply by the November 1 priority deadline, the Honors College will notify you of your status on or before December 15. Decisions will continue to be released on a monthly basis until April 15.  For transfer students, decisions will be released approximately one month after the deadline .        Are the Honors College and GPPA programs the same?            No, the GPPA program and the Honors College are complementary programs. While GPPA provides a guaranteed seat in one of UIC’s graduate or professional programs, the Honors College supports the undergraduate academic experience.  Many GPPA programs require participation in the Honors College.  For more information, visit the GPPA information session, or the GPPA website at gppa.uic.edu        I have more questions about the Honors College. Where can I get more information?            Visit the rest of the Honors College website or email us at hcollege@uic.edu.
