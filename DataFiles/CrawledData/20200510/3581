Today’s information systems are expected to reflect health care occurring across multiple health care delivery systems, across the lifespan, across urban and rural locations.  The PhD in Biomedical and Health Informatics is a recognized STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) Degree Program.  Under the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, international students who graduate from colleges and universities in the United States may be authorized to remain in the country and receive training through work experience for up to 12 months upon receiving employment authorization from the United States Citizenship Immigration Service (USCIS). Students who graduate from a designated STEM degree program may apply to USCIS for an additional 17 months of work authorization as part of the OPT STEM extension process.

Preliminary exam prep  Before you begin full-time dissertation research, you’ll need to complete your coursework and a comprehensive preliminary examination. Start preparing for that exam now!       Our curriculum immerses you in opportunities to learn within the framework of advanced scholarship in biomedical and health informatics.   Preliminary exam  You must pass a preliminary examination to advance to candidacy before you start your full-time dissertation research. After that, you’re able to enroll in BHIS 599 PhD Thesis Research .  Once you pass your preliminary exam, the rest of your time is based upon your progress in your dissertation proposal write up and defense, research, and oral defense of your dissertation.          Year 3    Year 4       Once you’re in the third year of your studies, you’ll be totally focused on research.   Fall  Prepare and defend your dissertation proposal.   Spring and Summer  Continue in BHIS 599 PhD Thesis Research and work towards the completion of your research and your defense.       Hurrah—you could be done as early as Fall of this year!  You’ll need to complete a written dissertation with oral defense at a public session before the dissertation committee and other members of the academic community.  Once this is done, you’re officially finished.
