02/28/2017 OIS NEWS - 05/24/2017 Coronavirus/COVID-19 Updates for the UIC International Community OIS NEWS - 5/08/2020 Money/Banking Currency   ATM:  Using an ATM card is a common way to withdraw  money in the U.S. ATM  machines are very common. ATM stands for  Automatic Teller Machine, and  is a machine that allows you to withdraw  cash from your bank account,  without having to be at your bank. Be  aware that most banks will  charge a fee if you use ATMs of another bank  on their machine. This can  add up quickly – so be careful!     Credit Card:  It is also common for people to pay for items by credit  card. Visa,  MasterCard and American Express cards are usually accepted  in most  grocery stores, retail shops and restaurants.     Exchanging Currency:  Most money can be exchanged at major banks and at most Currency Exchange Stores . In addition to exchanging currency, this store provides other  services,  such as sending money through Western Union, and providing CTA passes for purchase.  The following information may be helpful to those unfamiliar with   United States currency: One dollar ($1.00) equals “100” cents. Paper   money or “bills”, come in denominations of $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and   $100. Coins are in denominations as follows:   U.S. Currency    Coin Name  Value  Value as $    Penny  1 cent  $.01    Nickel  5 cents  $.05    Dime  10 cents  $.10    Quarter  25 cents  $.25    Half Dollar  50 cents  $.50    Dollar  100 cents  $1.00     To avoid delays and cash-flow problems, you may want to open a bank account with a U.S. bank before you arrive.    Banking      The two banks which are accustomed to working with Internationals and that you can find on-campus are Credit Union 1 and PNC Bank . There are also many banks around Chicago including Citibank , Chase Bank , and Bank of America , to name a few.  Following are UIC’s on-campus resources:  Credit Union 1  Complete banking services are offered by Credit Union 1 , which has three convenient locations on campus . Credit
