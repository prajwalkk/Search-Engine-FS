Once enrolled, a faculty advisor works with each student to create an individualized program plan. Program length depends on several factors, including the chosen focus area, full- or part-time enrollment, and route of entry:   Students entering with an MS typically complete the program in 2 to 4 years.  Students entering with a BSN typically complete the program in 3 to 5 years.  Students entering as licensed RNs with a bachelor’s in a non-nursing field typically complete the program in 4 to 6 years.        For APRNs who want to expand or deepen their expertise     For APRNs with MS degrees who want a DNP   APRNs who have a master’s degree in any of the 12 focus areas offered by the UIC College of Nursing may apply for a post-master’s DNP . The program will include didactic coursework as well as a DNP project and practicum experience. In the end, each student has the 1,000 clinical hours required to earn a DNP.      Learn about the post-master's DNP       For DNP-prepared APRNs who want another focus area   The post-DNP certificate programs are designed for DNP-prepared advanced practice nurses to qualify for national credentialing in a focus area in which they are not currently credentialed. Post-DNP certificates are offered in all 10 UIC Nursing programs that lead to advanced practice roles as nurse practitioners or nurse midwives. As with the full DNP program, the post-DNP programs admit students in the fall, and the application deadline is January 15.      Learn about post-DNP certificates            Are you an RN with a non-nursing bachelor's degree?       The DNP Transition Program is the route of entry to the DNP for students with an RN license and a bachelor’s degree in a field other than nursing.   Transition students are required to take up to four additional courses, determined upon admission. Courses are NURS 212, 242, 322 and 385 .  All transition courses are delivered online in eight-week modules taught by UIC Nursing faculty.  Students are assessed professional student tuition/fees, and course credits are applied the same as graduate degree courses.  All required transition courses are to be completed during the first fall/spring semesters following admission to the College of Nursing and before beginning any coursework in the DNP degree.

I am the first DNP in the history of STTI to be a plenary at this Congress, where over 40 countries were represented. A significant portion of my presentation was my DNP project. I am so proud to be a UIC College of Nursing alumnus!”    Dale Beatty, Chief Nursing Officer, Stanford Health Care, Palo Alto, CA | DNP '17          “The coursework and program is extremely demanding, but the faculty and your peers are with you every step of the way. There are also a lot of resources available within the college to help you. My coursework and clinical experiences have only strengthened my passion. I am so glad I decided to enroll in this program.”    Kelly White | DNP Class of 2019          Meet DNP students      All campuses offer this program        Chicago          Peoria          Quad Cities          Rockford          Springfield          Urbana           Take the next step        Check icon        Apply now        Calendar icon        Attend an info session        Envelope icon         Ask a question        Matrix icon                Request general information          Reach the program director   Need to reach the DNP program director?
