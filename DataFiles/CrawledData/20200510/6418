We're connecting successful alumni with those who are just getting started to ensure every UIC-educated nurse has the tools to lead.  When the UIC College of Nursing surveyed alumni in January 2017, we were happy to see that nearly 40 percent said they would be interested in a mentorship program. So we got right on it.  Launched in July 2019, the UIC College of Nursing Alumni Mentor Program’s purpose is to connect mid-career and seasoned alumni with early-career alumni. Mentors will share advice and information about areas of practice, navigating career paths, building networks, increasing self-confidence, honing leadership skills and other issues relevant to career advancement.  Why join?  It's simple. Mentored employees have been found to receive higher compensation, more promotions and feel more committed to their careers. On the flip side, mentors get a boost, too, reporting greater job satisfaction and commitment to their organization.  Alumni Mentor Program 2020-21 enrollment is now open!

Susan lent an empathic ear, provided insightful perspective, and challenged me as I considered the next steps in my nursing career. She is a kind and inspiring leader, and I am thankful to have her as a mentor. I hope UIC Nursing continues to provide this program because, in my opinion, no one inspires nurses as much as other nurses.”    Nicole Jacksetich, BSN ’15, RN | Speaking about her mentor, Susan Okuno-Jones, MS '06, Vice President and CNO, Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital          Alumni Mentor Program Taskforce    Beena Peters , DNP ’07, MS ’94, Taskforce chair, chief nursing officer, Cook County Health  David Barishman , BSN ’94, director of patient care services, UI Health  Ann Blouin , PhD ’94, retired, Joint Commission  Yolanda Coleman , PhD ’12, system assistant CNO, Sinai Health System  Melinda Cooling , MS ’03, DNP ’10, director of advanced practice, OSF HealthCare  Jamie Ghafari , MS ’11, director of patient care services, pediatrics and pediatric intensive care, UI Health  Alina Kraynak , DNP ’17, MS ’15, women’s health consultant, Minnesota Department of Health  Lynn Lenker , MS ’95, system CNIO, SSM Health  Susan Okuno-Jones , MS ’06, DNP ’10, vice president and chief nursing officer, Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital  Sarah Overton , BSN ’10, MS ’17, chief nursing officer and vice president of ambulatory nursing, OSF HealthCare  Kathleen Pavkov , BSN ’78, associate nurse executive – ambulatory services, Cook County Health  Janice Phillips , PhD ’93, director of nursing research and health equity, Rush University  Brian Stahulak, BSN ’97, senior vice president and chief nursing officer, Lurie Children’s Hospital            To learn more, contact:  Sara Almassian   Associate Director,  Alumni Engagement and Participation    Phone: (312) 996-2315  Email: salmas1@uic.edu             Alumni    Back to main content           Meet Our Alumni    Upcoming Events    Alumni Board    Alumni Mentor Program     Tips & Suggestions      Alumni Awards     List of Distinguished Alumni    List of Outstanding Achievement Awardees      REUNION    Vital Signs Magazine    Give to UIC Nursing     Faces of Philanthropy    IGNITE Priorities    Plan Your Gift     The Dean's Circle      Current Scholarship Recipients    Give Now      Update Your Information    Office of Advancement              College of Nursing  UI Health                        UIC's seven health sciences colleges and health care delivery enterprise.
