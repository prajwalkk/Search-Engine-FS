Academic integrity, a foundational element of all educational communities, is the value underpinning everything we do at UIC. It encompasses many behaviors, but the core idea is when you choose any action one might construe as “an unfair or undeserved academic advantage 1 ”, you undermine your learning, your goals, and your relationships within the UIC community. For a complete list of UIC’s Academic Integrity standards, please reference section IV.A. of the Student Disciplinary Policy .  1 deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct           Student Resources  College is often the time when students solidify their values around academic integrity.
