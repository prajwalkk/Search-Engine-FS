However, if you will be driving to campus regularly, purchasing a parking assignment may be more economical. If you plan to purchase a parking assignment, we encourage you to do so early.  For more information about parking options, check out the parking lot locations , rates and fees , and the parking application  if you want to get an assignment for the summer. You can contact Campus Parking at (312) 413-9020 or in person at their office locatedÂ in the Student Services Building (SSB), 1200 West Harrison Street, Room 2620.  Commuter Student Resource Center  If you commute to campus, the Commuter Student Resource Center in Student Center East has a kitchen, lockers and showers, and study lounge spaces you can use before and after class. You will need to present your  i-card for access.         Have a question? Chat live with Summer Session Staff!
