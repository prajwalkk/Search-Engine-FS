Users of the CS computer facilities are expected to abide by the system, protect the work of students, staff, and faculty, and preserve the right to access networks to which the university is connected.  You will be assigned a CS computer account to access CS facilities. An individual password will access your account, and it is against departmental and university policy to allow any other person to use your account. In addition, it is your responsibility to protect your account from unauthorized use by changing passwords periodically and using passwords that are not easy to “crack.”  The university and authorized department representatives reserve the right to access your account and the system at any time at their sole discretion. The department requires you to identify yourself clearly and accurately in all electronic communications. Concealing or misrepresenting your name or affiliation to mask irresponsible or offensive behavior is a serious abuse. Using identifiers of other individuals as your own constitutes fraud.  You are expected to take proper care of the equipment in CS facilities. Food, drink, and smoking (including electronic cigarettes) are not allowed in CS labs. Report any malfunction to the consultant on duty or send an email to support@cs.uic.edu . Do not attempt to move, repair, reconfigure, modify, or attach external devices (e.g., USB drives) to the systems. Please note that CS computer laboratories may post additional operational rules and restrictions that are considered part of the CS computer policy. You are responsible for reading and abiding by these additional restrictions.  Accept responsibility for your own work by learning appropriate uses of software to maintain the integrity of what you create. Keep archives and backup copies of important work. Learn and properly use the features for securing or sharing access to your files on any computer you use.  While great effort is made to keep the contents of what you create, store and set to be seen only by those to whom you intend or give permission, the university cannot and does not guarantee the security of electronic files in its computer systems. These systems can sometimes be breached. Additionally, as specified above, the university reserves the right to access its computer systems, including your account, if it deems appropriate.  You are expected to refrain from engaging in deliberate wasteful practices such as sending chain letters through electronic mail, printing unnecessary computations, or unnecessarily holding public terminals for long periods of time when others are waiting to use these resources.  Computer use for course-related assignments takes priority over exploratory use. In addition, the department may restrict access to certain programs for security or administrative purposes. Users are responsible for complying with program restrictions, which may be amended at any time.  Unauthorized transfer of copyrighted materials to or from the CS computer system without express consent of the owner is a violation of federal law. In addition, use of the Internet for commercial gain or profit is not allowed from an educational site.  Use of electronic mail and other network communications facilities to harass, offend, or annoy other users of the network is forbidden. All users need to be aware that obscene, defamatory, or any other material that violates university policy on non-discrimination will not be tolerated on the CS computer system. The department will take whatever action is needed to prevent, correct, or discipline behavior that violates this policy.  Any attempt to circumvent system security, guess other passwords, or in any way gain unauthorized access to local or network resources is forbidden. Distributing passwords or otherwise attempting to evade, disable or “crack” passwords or other security provisions threatens the work of many others and is therefore grounds for immediate suspension of your privileges and possible expulsion from the department. You may not develop programs or use any mechanisms to alter or avoid accounting for the use of computing services or to employ means by which the facilities and systems are used anonymously or by means of an alias.  Violations of policy will be treated as academic, civil, or criminal misconduct. In disciplining computer services and facilities violations, the department reserves the right to pursue all academic disciplinary measures available. Disciplinary measures may include warnings, suspension of computer privileges (temporary or permanent), or expulsion from the university. The department also reserves the right to immediately suspend user privileges for potential violations of these guidelines. Such action will be taken to protect the security and integrity of the CS computer system and will take precedence over its impact on an individual’s work.  The department will investigate apparent or alleged violations of these guidelines. When appropriate and at the discretion of the department, cases of apparent abuse will be reported to the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs (student cases) or the Vice Chancellor for Human Resources (faculty and staff cases). These offices are responsible for determining any further disciplinary actions. The university may also pursue civil and/or criminal charges if it deems appropriate.  Issues concerning these guidelines or allegations of harassment or other irresponsible use of computing resources should be brought to the attention of the CS computer lab consultants or the CS computer support staff.
