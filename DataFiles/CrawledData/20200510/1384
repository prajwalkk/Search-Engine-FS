Those rights include …   Reasonable Adjustments – Provide reasonable adjustments, like a larger desk, elevator access, or allowing you to make frequent trips to the restroom, when necessary because of your pregnancy.

Make-Up Work – Students returning to class must be allowed to return to the same academic status as before the medical leave began and given the opportunity to make up any work missed during the leave. This includes an opportunity to make-up "class participation" points that student missed by virtue of not being in class. Further, any deadlines that were missed during the leave must be extended to allow submission of work.
