The M2 curriculum is organ system-based and examinations typically occur following instruction in two- or three-organ systems. M2 students also sit for the pathology, pharmacology, pathophysiology, and microbiology subject examinations from the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) as part of the M2 grading process; they are assessed for clinical skills utilizing standardized patients. M3 testing consists of the administration of six (6) NBME subject examinations, one of which is given at the end of each M3 hospital-based clerkship (medicine, obstetrics & gynecology, pediatrics, family medicine, psychiatry and surgery). A mock Step 2 CS standardized patient exercise is offered to all M3s at the end of the academic year. M4 testing testing is clerkship dependent and examinations could be in written or clinical assessment format.   Evaluation Evaluation of student performance includes examinations developed by the faculty, standardized examinations, small group activities, demonstration of acquired skills on models and patients and interactions with faculty in clinical settings. Evaluation schemas are developed for each M2 course, and University-approved evaluation criteria are utilized on clinical clerkships and rotations. All student records are held in accordance with University guidelines and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA). The College of Medicine will not release personally identifiable academic records to a third party without the written consent of the student. The office of medical education and evaluation holds a copy of the University guidelines for the maintenance of student records.
