UIC Password        UIC Password Management  The One ID and Password (OIDPW) phase of the University of Illinois Identity and Access Management (IAM) Project ( http://web.uillinois.edu/IAM ) was successfully implemented at the UIC campus on October 17, 2016. For more information about the One ID and Password project please see ACCC News & Alerts .  New Password Manager   The new Password Manager is available at: http://identity.uillinois.edu  Use the Password Manager to set up new password recovery options because any ACCC password recovery options you may have set up in the past will be retired.  Use the new University of Illinois Password Management system to manage the password for both your UIC NetID and your Enterprise ID, which will be synced upon completion of your next password reset.   Legacy Password Manager  There are a few circumstances when you should use our local UIC Password Manager instead:   You need to change the password on a secondary NetID instead of your primary NetID. To do so, login with your secondary netid when prompted.  If you are already logged in with your primary netid, you must close your browser and start over, using your secondary netid to login.  Your UIC password has expired and you have never used the new Password Manager.  You need to change the password on an account type that doesn't use the same password as your NetID (such as ADSM or Voicemail).  If any of the above apply to you, then proceed to the legacy UIC Password Manager: http://changepassword.uic.edu  If you forgot your UIC password and you have never used the new Password Manager please visit our Account Portal page .      Activate UIC Netid  If you have not yet activated your netid
for use at UIC, use this link to setup your password, password recovery options, and 
email.  Test your password   Test
             the strength of your password . The tester runs entirely
           in the browser and does not transmit your password over
           the network.  Password managers  Password managers help you store encrypted passwords and manage
           them using a master password. Use a password manager .    Don't share your password  UIC will never ask you to send your password in email.          © 2016 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois
