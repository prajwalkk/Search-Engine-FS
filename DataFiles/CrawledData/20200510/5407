To enhance this mission, the University of Illinois at Chicago Police Department has created a “Safe Exchange Zone”.  Keep in mind, however, that although the transaction can occur in the lobby of the police department at 943 W. Maxwell St., neither law enforcement nor university officials will be involved in any part of the transaction.  The purpose of the UICPD Safe Exchange Zone is to provide the university community with an area that they can conduct the exchange of their online transactions or even make child custody exchanges in a safe, neutral environment that is comfortable, well-lit and under video surveillance 24 hours a day.  Possession of weapons on university property is prohibited, so exchanges involving weapons are not permitted in the space.  Designated parking spaces are located adjacent to the police station.  UICPD does prohibit some transactions at the Safe Exchange Zone   Illegal transactions, including, but not limited to contraband, narcotics, illegal substances, stolen property, or other illegal items and/or exchanges  Transactions involving firearms, firearms parts, ammunition or explosives. Possession of weapons on university property is prohibited.  Large, bulky items that would disrupt the operations of the police facility  The delivery of any packages or goods to these facilities on behalf of a purchaser   For your safety   Only do transactions with local buyers/sellers  Do not go to a transaction alone  Make sure a friend or family member is aware of the transaction details  Insist on meeting in a public area like our safe transaction zone  Do not go into someone else’s house, and do not allow them into yours  Complete the transaction during daylight hours  Be extra cautious when buying or selling valuable items such as vehicles and jewelry  Only use cash or money orders to complete your transactions  Trust your instincts, if it sounds like a scam it probably is  If somebody is not willing to come to the police department to do a transaction it is probably not a legitimate transaction.
