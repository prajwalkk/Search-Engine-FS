In addition to instrument access, EMC staff offer advice, hands-on training, education and research collaboration. EMC aims to promote, enable, and encourage cutting-edge education and research using the core’s instrumentation.    Fluorescence Imaging Core   The facility will work to accommodate any biological research that requires light, deconvolution, confocal, TIRF, and/or widefield fluorescent microscopy.     Nanotechnology Core Facility  The primary mission of the NCF is to provide R&D expertise and service support to the research efforts of both University faculty and external commercial companies in the wide-ranging areas of MEMS/NEMS, electronic and photonic material device design and fabrication, using all aspects of photolithography, deposition by electron beam, DC/RF sputtering, and plasma systems as well as low-pressure chemical vapor deposition, deep reactive ion material etching and wafer thermal oxidation.  The NCF also provides instrument training on the systems above as well as most film characterization techniques including XRD, SEM, AFM, Optical Profilometry, Step Profilometry, Ellipsometry, Dynamic Laser Scattering, Thermogravimetric Analysis, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Rapid Thermal Processing and Scanning Acoustical Microscopy. Rudimentary device packaging services such as laser marking, wafer saw cutting and wire bonding can be provided by request.    Preclinical Imaging Core   The Preclinical Imaging Core facility is located in the basement of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Laboratory (NMRL) building. The facility houses: a 31cm bore size 9.4T Agilent MRI system that can provide the full support of MRS and MRI studies in small animals (including mouse, rat, rabbit); a 129 Xe hyperpolarizer that is being installed to provide high-purity, hyperpolarized 129 Xe for gas phase magnetic resonance studies.     Research Histology and Tissue Imaging Core   The mission of the Research Histology and Tissue Imaging Core is to provide high throughput histological and digital microscopy imaging services for reproducible, automated analysis of biomarkers expression levels in human and animal tissues as well as for measurements of spatial and temporal features of biological objects.
