Making Summer Session Part of the Strategy  UIC’s Summer Session offers students the options they need. With the flexibility offered by UIC’s two sessions, summer jobs and family vacations can still be part of the picture. Here are a few important things to know about UIC’s Summer Session:   Broad course selection: UIC offers more than 250 courses in 50 different subject areas—including many hard-to-find upper-level courses.    Teaching excellence: Classes are taught by UIC’s excellent faculty—many summer courses are taught by faculty at the top of their academic fields.    Scheduling flexibility: UIC offers two summer sessions—an intensive 4-week session that begins May 18 one week after UIC’s spring semester ends; and an 8-week session that begins June 15. Courses in either session are the equivalent of a full semester. Students can take one session or both—and earn up to 12 credit hours in just 12 weeks.
