Engineering physicists are engaged more deeply on the scientific end than most.  With UIC’s engineering physics major, you will develop a command of physics that will make you especially competitive in roles that require an understanding of science and theory, such as research and development positions.  Engineering physics majors take nine physics courses. After completing General Physics I (which focuses on mechanics) and General Physics II (which is about electricity and magnetism), EP majors delve the scientific method, quantum theory, waves, thermal physics, quantum and theoretical mechanics, experimental physics, and other topics.  If scientific inquiry—the research that will fuel the next generation of engineering advances—is your area of interest, an engineering physics major is a rewarding choice.  The UIC course catalog lays out all of the degree requirements for the EP major. The overview below gives a survey of what you can expect.       Engineering Physics Major Requirements   Engineering physics majors complete coursework in four categories:   Nonengineering and general education courses: Nonengineering and general education courses provide a foundation in math and science and will make you a well-informed graduate in disciplines outside of bioengineering. You will take 72 credit hours in this area, including the nine courses in physics that will develop your expertise in this scientific discipline. For details on these requirements, consult the course catalog .  Required engineering courses: EP majors earn 44 credit hours from a slate of required engineering courses. The list includes Properties of Materials, Introduction to Electromagnetics and Applications, and Fluid Mechanics I. For details on these requirements, please consult the course catalog .  Mathematics-related elective: Students choose one high-level math course (3 credit hours) that builds their knowledge in an area relevant to their program. Options include Applied Linear Algebra, Complex Analysis with Applications, Applied Differential Equations, Applied Partial Differential Equations, Numerical Analysis, and Probability and Random Processes for Engineers.  Technical electives: Engineering physics majors complete 9 credit hours from a list that draws from both Department of Physics offerings and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offerings. You can find this list in the course catalog .        Academic Tracks within ECE   The ECE department has identified groups of courses that can help guide your academic planning based on the areas of electrical and computer engineering in which you seek to specialize. You can find descriptions of each track and its associated courses on this page .

These are called our educational program objectives . Within a few years of graduation, our talented graduates will:   Contribute to their employers, organizations, and communities.  Be leaders in their professions around the world and expand engineering knowledge in a variety of communities.  Practice and exhibit high ethical values and communicate effectively with colleagues and the public.  Pursue advanced degrees or become engineers, researchers, innovators, consultants, or entrepreneurs.        Student Outcomes: EP Major   Another part of the ABET accreditation process requires the department to identify the specific knowledge and skills that students are intended to have when they complete their undergraduate education. These are called student outcomes .  Students graduating from the electrical engineering, computer engineering, and engineering physics programs at UIC will have:   an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics.  an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors.  an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences.  an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts.  an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives.  an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions.  an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.   In the 2019-2020 academic year, 20 students were enrolled at UIC Engineering as engineering physics majors across all class years. The department graduated three engineering physics majors in the academic year ending May 2019.      Apply to UIC!
