It recognizes faculty members who have had a significant impact on their field through scholarship, creativity, and leadership.  In 2019, the College of Engineering created a public lecture series titled Reflections to recognize each new UIC Distinguished Professor from the College. Faculty members who are elevated to this rank deliver a spoken memoir of a research career, looking back at the science, pivotal moments, and collaborations that led to their present achievements. Reflections lectures are meant to be broadly accessible to a scientific audience. They bring together the entire College community to celebrate the work of colleagues and to set an aspirational bar for all.  The inaugural Reflections lecture was held in March 2019.
