The UIC John Marshall Law School Library primarily serves the faculty and students of JMLS and is administered separately from the UIC University Library. Nevertheless, the Law Library does provide services to the UIC community.      This is a list of Frequently Asked Questions about this transition, relevant to University Library patrons.  For more information, please Contact the UIC Library .  Do UIC users have access to the JMLS Library?  Yes. Individuals generally will need a UIC ID to enter Law School premises.  Where is the JMLS Library located?  The Law School Library is at 315 South Plymouth Court, 6th Floor, Chicago IL 60654.  What are the visiting hours for the JMLS Library?  JMLS Library hours are listed on its website .  Will UIC users have access to the electronic resources of the JMLS Library?  UIC faculty, students and staff will have access to many of the JMLS Law Library’s electronic resources, but only from computers on-site at the JMLS Library. Many of the law resources are too expensive to license for the entire UIC campus, and some are restricted to law students and faculty only. Feel free to call the JMLS Reference Desk at 312-427-2737, ext. 729 to confirm whether a database is available before going to the JMLS Library.  How can UIC users borrow print materials from the JMLS Library?  Until UIC and JMLS catalogs are merged in 2021, UIC users can check out materials in person at JMLS, or request print materials from the JMLS Library through Interlibrary Loan .  Will UIC students and faculty have access to the reference services of the JMLS Library?  Yes. Law librarians will provide specialized legal reference services to the broader UIC community. This service will be mediated behind the scenes by the librarians. UIC students and faculty outside the College of Law should begin with the chat, email, or in-person services at their college’s primary library (e.g., Daley Library, Library of the Health Sciences).  Will the JMLS Library continue to have its own website?  Yes, the current plan is to re-brand the JMLS Library web pages with UIC URLs, logos, and colors but maintain an independent site. At some point in the future, the law library website may be more integrated into the University Library website structure.  Will the JMLS Library maintain its own catalog?  Yes, until 2021. The Law Library will maintain its current integrated library system, including online public access catalog (OPAC), until a cutover to the UIC system in 2021. The UIC Library is in the process of transitioning to a new catalog system, with a go live estimated for June 2020. After that migration is complete, the Law School will begin to migrate to the new UIC catalog system, with an estimated go live of summer 2021. Until the merging of library systems in 2021, users will need to use the Law School catalog to locate materials in the law collection. For all other UIC materials, users will need to access the UIC Library Catalog. There will be a link on the Law Library website to the UIC Catalog.  Will the JMLS Library be open to the public?  No. The Law Library’s current access policy will still apply, with the addition of access to all UIC students, faculty, and staff. UIC alumni can access the Law Library as outlined in the FAQ below. The Collaboration Commons (8th floor of the State Street building) is not part of the Law Library and has a separate access policy that restricts access to JMLS students and faculty.  Will JMLS and UIC alumni have access to each other’s Libraries?  Yes, alumni of either institution will have access to the collections and facilities of the other’s library, per the policies of each Library. Circulating physical material may be checked out, but remote access to electronic resources is not permitted.  UIC and JMLS alumni can apply for an Alumni Borrowing Card . UIC alumni will need to present an Alumni Borrowing Card and a photo ID to JMLS Security to gain access to the Law School and Library. JMLS alumni will continue to be issued JMLS ID cards for access to the facility and Law Library borrowing, but they will need to get an Alumni Borrowing Card to borrow from the other UIC libraries.  Will UIC users have access to the JMLS network, Wi-Fi, or telephone systems?  UIC visitors will have access to the JMLS guest Wi-Fi.  How can a UIC user print at the JMLS Library?  UIC visitors will have access to a print station to print using the UIC Wēpa print system. This print station will be implemented in the Fall 2019 semester.
