These two tools will be available without cost for all our courses until May 31st, 2020.  Respondus LockDown Browser is a custom browser that locks down the testing environment for tests taken in Blackboard. If you enable LockDown Browser for a Blackboard test, students will be unable to copy, print, access other applications, visit other websites, or close the test until it is submitted. LockDown Browser functions much like a standard browser, but some options have been removed or work differently. If instructors want further proctoring features, they can also require Respondus Monitor , which uses a web camera to record a student during the exam in addition to LockDown Browser.

All access to other applications is disabled.  Students cannot enter a web address to go to another site, and they cannot open other tabs (unless a link to another site is included within a test question).  The browser is displayed full-screen and cannot be minimized, resized, or exited until the test is submitted.  All printing, keyboard shortcuts (including copy/paste), screen capture, function keys, and right-click menus are disabled.            More Info   Accessing and Enabling Respondus LockDown Browser  Once you have created and deployed a test in your course, you can configure it to require the Respondus LockDown Browser by browsing to Control Panel > Course Tools > Respondus LockDown Browser .  If a student tries to use a regular browser to access a test that has Respondus enabled, Blackboard will notify them that they need to use Respondus to access the test.  Note: Instructors do not need to install any additional software. However, students must install additional software to take the online test.  Installation for Students  Students will need to download and install Respondus LockDown Browser on their own computer to use it, through the Respondus download link .  Recommended Best Practices  Respondus LockDown Browser is straightforward to use, but there are some suggested best practices that will help it go smoothly for your students.   Do not change test name – Once you have enabled Respondus LockDown Browser on a test, do not change the name of the test, or Respondus will not work correctly  Do not modify the test password – If you want to set a password for the test, do so via the Respondus LockDown Browser settings and not the Test Settings. Respondus uses the password field to prevent students from taking the test from another browser, and modifying the password in Test Settings will prevent it from working correctly  Add a statement to the syllabus – Explain to students early that they must use Respondus LockDown Browser for their online exams. Respondus provides a sample syllabus statement you may want to include or modify  Hold a practice test or quiz – Before students need to use Respondus LockDown Browser for a high-stakes test or a quiz, have them complete a brief practice quiz to demonstrate that they have installed the browser and it is functioning correctly. This quiz can be for a few points extra credit or no points   Respondus Monitoring  Once a Blackboard test is created and deployed in the course, the instructor can choose to require just the LockDown Browser, or the instructor can also require Respondus Monitoring, which is remote proctoring, watch this Respondus Monitoring video for more information.
