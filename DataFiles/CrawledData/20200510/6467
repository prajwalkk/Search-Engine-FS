These are just some of our #facesonthefront.   ‘No one has ever done this’   UIC Nursing clinical assistant professor Rebecca Singer , DNP ’18, RN, pulls from her background working with Doctors Without Borders to manage a COVID-19 testing site for UI Health employees.   ‘Providing comfort and closure’   Graduate-entry MS student Jenine Johnson , who shifted careers to nursing in her 40s, says she may be one of the last faces a dying COVID patient sees.   ‘A small thing, but so practical’   Recognizing that critical COVID-19 patients likely wouldn’t think to bring their cell phone chargers to the hospital with them, Megan Cairns Tress , MS ’18, is trying to raise enough money to buy the critical lifeline for every hospital bed she can.   UIC Nursing APRNs help run UI Health COVID-19 clinic   Last month, the UI Health Pilsen Family Health Center Lower West was a comprehensive family clinic. Now, it’s serving as a temporary COVID-19 assessment site, staffed by an interprofessional team of providers, including UIC Nursing’s Carolyn Dickens , Janey Kottler and Karen Cotler .   ‘We have to do it in a different way now’   Elisabeth Schreiber , MS ’11, left her 8-year-long job as an emergency room nurse in 2014 to become a nurse practitioner (and, ultimately, clinical lead) in the UI Health Clinical Decision Unit. But the COVID-19 crisis has brought her back to her old crew, triaging patients in an expanded role.   ‘This is a marathon, not a sprint’   Tom McClure , BSN ’18, is caring for the most severely ill COVID-19 patients as an ICU nurse at Memorial Medical Center in Springfield, where he recognizes he’s in the midst of a “marathon, not a sprint.”   ‘Plans changed’   Janey Kottler , DNP, FNP-BC, clinical instructor and nurse practitioner at the nurse-led Mile Square Health Center – Humboldt Park, was supposed to be returning from her honeymoon in Panama on Monday, March 30. Instead, she was working at the UI Health Pilsen Family Health Center Lower West assessing patients for COVID-19.   ‘They’re so vulnerable and fragile’   Karen Cotler , UIC Nursing clinical assistant professor, normally spends her Fridays providing primary care to patients who visit a needle exchange site. The pandemic has hindered her ability to reach this disenfranchised population, but she’s still committed to caring for them.   ‘It hit me very hard’   Annette Lopez , a senior BSN student graduating in May, understood why senior year milestones needed to be canceled or postponed. But working on a COVID floor has driven it home.   Check back for updates.
