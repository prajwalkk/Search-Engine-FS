Those experiencing or witnessing student mistreatment are strongly encouraged to report it immediately. Consistent with the UI COM Positive Learning Environment Policy , reports of medical student mistreatment and other learning environment concerns will be taken seriously. Detailed information about the various methods for reporting and the process that follows is available in Reporting Medical Student Mistreatment and Other Learning Environment Concerns  and the Report Flowcharts . One such method for reporting is the online report form, which can be accessed by clicking on the button below: Report Student Mistreatment This online report form may be used by anyone to report an incident of medical student mistreatment you have experienced or observed. Reports submitted through this form will be reviewed by the UI COM Director of Medical Student Learning Environment (DMSLE) ** within 2 business days to determine next steps. As such, you should not use this form to report events presenting an immediate threat to the health or safety of any person, including yourself. If there is an immediate risk to health or safety of any person, please call 911 to connect with medical support or local law enforcement. Discrimination/Harassment/Sexual Misconduct Any reports of student mistreatment/learning environment concerns that include claims of sex or gender-based discrimination, harassment, assault and/or Sexual Misconduct , should also be reported to the UIC Title IX Coordinator.
