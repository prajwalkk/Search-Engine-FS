Policy on Conflicts of Interest in the Admissions Process     Policy on Conflicts of Interest in the Admissions Process         Policy on Conflicts of Interest in the Admissions Process   The Graduate College recognizes that the graduate admissions process does not, and should not, operate “blindly.” Programs and faculty members frequently recruit students of whom they have direct knowledge. Furthermore, the admission process for a doctoral program will frequently take into account the “fit’ between a prospective graduate student’s interests and those of the faculty in the program. However, the admissions process should, and should be seen to, take into account only academic and programmatic considerations when admitting and recruiting students.    Policy:  Program faculty participating in the graduate admissions process shall recuse themselves in any case where they have, or appear to have, a conflict of interest concerning the applicant.  A conflict of interest is present if the faculty may have an interest in the outcome (admission or rejection) other than the recruitment of the most qualified applicants. This includes, in particular, any situation where there is the possibility that a faculty member might employ a prospective graduate student in a non-university activity, such as a consulting firm, biotechnology company, etc. Particular care must be taken when voting on the admission of students whose qualifications are in any fashion marginal.   Commentary:  A conflict of interest could also be caused by faculty seeking to recruit students to work on grant supported projects, with the possibility that students would be recruited on the basis of their suitability to carry out a given function or functions on the project. This also falls under the heading “faculty may have an interest in the outcome (admission or rejection) other than the recruitment of the most qualified applicants”. To exclude principal investigators on grant supported projects would exclude the faculty with the most interest in the recruitment of excellent students. Nonetheless, faculty should be aware of the potential conflicts when evaluating students. One fundamental difference between the case of students being employed on campus and off campus is that the Graduate College has an ability to manage on campus relationships that it does not with off campus relationships.   *Approved by the Graduate College Executive Committee, December 2, 2011             Contacts        Phone icon        Contact UIC Admissions        Phone icon        Contact the Graduate College             Admissions    Back to main content           Degree Admissions     Domestic Admission    International Admission      Application Deadlines                   UIC Logo         Graduate  College           Campus Resources    Academic Calendar    UIC Today    Event Calendar    UIC Maps    Visit & Directions    Clery Compliance    Nondiscrimination Policy    Title IX: Sexual Misconduct    Student Information Disclosures      Staff Resources    my UIC    UIC Outlook Online    GoogleApps@UIC    Site Login      Student Resources    Wellness Center    Writing Center    UIC Pop-Up Pantry         Contact   Graduate College  601 S.
