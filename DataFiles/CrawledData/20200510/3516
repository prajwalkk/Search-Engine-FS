The faculty positions start on August 16, 2020, or on a mutually agreed date thereafter.  For full consideration, applications must be received by December 13, 2019. Applications will continue to be accepted until the positions are filled.  Overview: The successful candidate is expected to establish and sustain an outstanding research program, as well as be strongly committed to student success both at graduate and undergraduate levels. Areas of particular interest include: (i) power electronics and power systems (including smart grid, renewable-energy systems, and wide-bandgap technologies), (ii) artificial intelligence (including machine learning, data science, robotics, autonomous vehicles, cyber physical systems, internet of things, control, optimization for dynamic systems, and AI optimized hardware), (ii) computer system security, software and hardware, and (iv) quantum devices and computing. However, exceptional candidates in all other areas of ECE will also be considered. Candidates working on multidisciplinary research are especially encouraged to apply.  Qualifications: A Ph.D. in computer engineering, electrical engineering, or a related field is required, with the degree requirements completed before the date of appointment.  Duties: The role of tenured/tenure-track faculty member in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering is to perform teaching, research, and professional and university service, in support of the mission of the university and the College of Engineering by preparing students for careers of leadership and innovation in electrical and computer engineering and related fields. The faculty member is expected to advise undergraduate and graduate students, and to possess the enthusiasm and energy to motivate students and attract them into the department’s programs. The faculty member is also expected to expand the base of electrical and computer engineering knowledge through original research, demonstrating scholarship through publications and graduate student supervision. Finally, knowledge of contemporary methods and research practices of all globally ongoing research in his or her area of specialization is required.  Applications should include: (1) a letter of application indicating the area(s) of expertise and candidate’s qualifications, (2) curriculum vitae, (3) names and contact information of at least three references entered in the reference tab, (4) separate concise statements outlining future teaching and research plans, (5) diversity statement.

Bridge to the Faculty Postdoctoral Fellowship for Diverse Faculty         listing   Bridge to the Faculty Postdoctoral Fellowship for Diverse Faculty  The University of Illinois at Chicago invites applications for a Bridge to the Faculty  Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, to begin August 16, 2020.  Purpose: Bridge to the Faculty is a new postdoctoral program designed to recruit scholars with the goal of transitioning them to faculty members after two years. Successful post-docs will have the opportunity to transition to faculty starting in the 2022-2023 academic year. This recruitment initiative aims to attract and retain promising scholars to UIC as well as diversify our faculty. Fellows will participate in a mentoring experience, with the opportunity to meet other Fellows and faculty through the Diverse Faculty Learning Community (Office of Diversity and the Office of the Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs).  The Bridge to the Faculty Fellowship is funded by the Chancellor’s Office, and administered through the Office of the Provost.  Eligibility:  The ECE department is looking for a dynamic postdoctoral research associate with experience in Electromagnetics and Wireless Communication. The postdoctoral research associate will work on a project with members of the ECE faculty in the Andrew Electromagnetics Laboratory. The sought candidate has a strong background in RF/microwave/milimeter-wave front-end technologies, antennas, circuits, and wireless systems. Such a candidate would enhance existing strengths in the department (i.e., Electromagnetics, Communications, Networking, and Hardware) and contribute to the establishment of an Engineering Research Center on “nG wireless” aimed to pioneer future communications networks (e.g., 6G and beyond). The department envisions that the postdoctoral research associate will assist exisiting faculty to initiate the process for the creation of the “nG wireless” research center, offer courses in related programs, increase the visibility of the department through scholarly work published in high-impact journals and conferences, and help secure federal and industrial grants.  UIC seeks applicants whose creative work/research, teaching and service will contribute to diversity and equal opportunity in higher education. The program is particularly interested in scholars with the potential to bring to their academic careers the critical perspective that comes from their non-traditional educational background or understanding of the experiences of groups historically underrepresented in higher education. The position is available in the Fall 2020 semester and the initial term of employment will be for 24 months. PhD must be obtained by within 5 years before August 16, 2020.
