While applications or packages typically require that they be downloaded in their entirety before using them, streaming allows you to play the video as the data stream arrives. Streaming media is transmitted by a server and displayed through a media player.  ACCC offers three ways to stream video and audio for your teaching needs. The best tool for you will depend on the situation and the other learning tools you are using. Echo360 is primarily used to stream classroom-based recorded lectures, while Panopto is used for instruction supported by Blackboard Learn. Google Drive is convenient if used as independent software or just to store media.      ACCC offers various options so you can choose which best suits your teaching style        Echo360 Platform  Record lectures and poll students in real time, or create videos outside of the classroom to watch anytime.          Google Drive  Store and play videos directly from Google Drive on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.          Panopto  Capture and edit video, add captions, create video assignments, and insert interactive video quizzes.
