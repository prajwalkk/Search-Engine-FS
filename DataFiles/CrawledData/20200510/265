This research focuses on designing and assessing educational technologies by utilizing human-centered methods and interaction modeling in HCI, and on interest, motivation and social-cultural learning perspectives in the learning sciences. These technologies are designed for social connection-making with learners to support learning and interest through long-term engagement, in ways that seamlessly integrate into existing educational activities in classrooms, informal learning environments, and at home.  My current research focuses on designing learning companion and classroom assistant robots to work with children at home and at school while learning in STEM disciplines. Companion robots “talk” to children while they read augmented books or participate in science activities by providing comments tailored to their interests and ability. The classroom assistant robots work with teachers and students to foster improved classroom orchestration and supports for collaborative learning. The goal of each child-robot interaction is to build social connections, provide collaboration and learning support, and to promote interest in reading and learning in STEM.
