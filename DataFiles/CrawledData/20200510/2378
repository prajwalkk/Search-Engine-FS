To allow for people to have open access to solutions and systems to improve their lives. This SIG deals with hardware, software, and medical field. CURRENT PROJECT Our goal is to create a system that  allows for automatic regulation of the blood glucose levels in a Type 1 (also known as Juvenile ) Diabetic.  We'll be making an efficient system that makes use of current technology and linking them together to work in tandem to allow for a safer and easier regulation of a subject's blood glucose levels  METHODOLOGY All projects will be Open source There will be a lot of data analysis as well as coding so for those who have no coding experience all are welcome. This is entirely self driven and for self motivated people. There will be no lecture like in other sigs Do all this while making ourselves look good for employers  Leaders Ben Maciorowski Contact Email the Leader: Ben Maciorowski <bmacio2 [at] uic [dot] edu>  Additional Resources https://github.com/Benbigmac/Artificial-Pancreas-System                 Search         ACM Tools    Calendar    Mailing List Signup    UIC Mega Pathfinder    UIC Linux Guides    ACM Wiki    ACM IRC    ACM Mail    ACM Git Project Hosting    Public Git Projects      Committees    Program Committee    Publicity Committee    Membership Committee    Ways and Means Committee    Flourish!
