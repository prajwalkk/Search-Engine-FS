According to the most recent report card issued by the American Society of Civil Engineers, more than a third of the 600,000 bridges in the United States are more than 50 years old. About 32 percent of urban roads and 14 percent of rural roads are in poor condition. Our network of water pipes is aging.  UIC will contribute to improvements by uniting renowned researchers, energetic students, and forward-thinking companies and agencies in our laboratory, which:   Offers unique faculty-developed damage-detection sensors that can generate big data on structural degradation and real-time 3D immersive visualization;  Allows us to monitor key elements of structural health, such as fiber-optic strain and acoustic emission;  Sets the stage for UIC to be first in developing revolutionary new materials, such as metamaterials that allow new structural designs for buildings and bridges;  Is the Chicago area's only high-bay structural testing laboratory.        About the Lab      General specs   6,000 square feet  45-foot high ceiling  30-foot high L-shaped strong wall  6-foot thick strong floor   Primary objectives   Design and test resilient, energy efficient, reliable infrastructure  Extend the life of existing infrastructure  Explore innovative new materials        Equipment and Systems   The civil and materials engineering department is now building out the High-Bay Structures Laboratory with the equipment, systems, and features needed to meet the requirements of the industry and agency partners, faculty, and students who will conduct tests in the facility. Expand the section below to see the full list.      Planned Equipment and Systems         1   Major Equipment   Main hydraulic pump with all the needed hydraulic pipes to all ports (as noted on the drawings)  Closed loop servo-hydraulic actuators up to 150 kips and strokes up to 15 inches (4 actuators)  Closed loop servo-hydraulic hydraulic actuators up to 300 kips and strokes up to 20 inches (4 actuators)  Other actuators: two each with capacities of 100 kips, 50 kips, and 20 kips.
