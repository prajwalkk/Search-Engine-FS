The UIC Applied Health Science Building gets 10 beautiful posters for its first-ever stairwell messaging campaign.  “The goal was to provide sound nutrition science to anyone taking the stairs,” says Amy McNeil , who developed and teaches the nutrition course involved. “Presenting that information visually makes it so much more interesting and easy to absorb.”  Research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that physical improvements to stairwells, including motivational signage, can increase the use of stairs by occupants of multistory workplaces.  Each poster offers beautifully presented, useful information as well as a QR code that takes readers to more details, recipes, shopping tips and the like.  “Most of our students will go into careers working for and with clients,” says John Daugherty , BVIS program director and instructor for the illustration students who took part. “In this, they got good experience and exposure to real client relationships.”  “Collaboration is never all smooth sailing,” adds McNeil, “and working through differences of opinion is where the learning happens. That’s what collaboration is.”         Biomedical and Health Information Sciences    Back to main content           Admissions and Programs    Expand Admissions and Programs menu          BS in Health Information Management    Expand BS in Health Information Management menu          What to Expect    Before You Apply    Applying    Expand Applying menu          Transferring from another UIC program      After You Apply      Minor in Life Science Visualization    Expand Minor in Life Science Visualization menu          What to Expect    Applying      MS in Biomedical Visualization    Expand MS in Biomedical Visualization menu          What to Expect    Before You Apply    Applying    After You Apply    Meet Our Students    Expand Meet Our Students menu          Class of 2020    Class of 2021        MS in Health Informatics    PhD in Biomedical and Health Informatics    Expand PhD in Biomedical and Health Informatics menu          What to Expect    Before You Apply    Applying    After You Apply    Faculty      Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Health Information Management    Post-Master’s Certificate in Health Informatics    Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Health Informatics      News    Calendar    Directory    Contact                College of  Applied Health  Sciences       UI Health Logo                            Quick Links    Calendar    Directory    News    Inside AHS    Graduation      Resources    Academic Support and Achievement Program    Student Resources    Faculty and Staff Resources    Academic Calendar      Tools    myUIC    GoogleApps@UIC    Webmail    Blackboard    Nessie        Connect with AHS    Contact us    Apply Now    Give to AHS         1919 W Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60612  312-996-6695  ahsinfo@uic.edu    Social Media Accounts      Facebook      Twitter      LinkedIn      Instagram      YouTube                     UIC.edu links   UIC.edu  Academic Calendar  Athletics  Campus Directory  Disability Resources  Emergency Information  Event Calendar  Job Openings  Library  Maps  UIC News  UI Health  Veterans Affairs        © 2020 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois |  Privacy Statement    Campuses   University of Illinois System  Urbana-Champaign  Springfield
