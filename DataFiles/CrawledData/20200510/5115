The University of Illinois Statutes authorize the faculty senate on each campus to be the legislative body for matters of educational policy. According to the Statutes, the UIC Faculty Senate determines “matters of educational policy including but not limited to: requirements for admission to the several colleges, schools and other teaching divisions; general requirements for degrees and certificates; relations among colleges, schools and other teaching divisions; the academic calendar; and educational policy on student affairs.” The UIC Senate Committee on Educational Policy ( SCEP ) reviews matters related to educational policy and makes recommendations to the full Senate.
