Take the Survey                 What is Evidence Based Medicine?      Sackett, et al. defined Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) as “ the integration of best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values . ”  -- Sackett DL, Straus SE, Richardson WS, Rosenberg W Haynes RB. "Evidence-based Medicine: How to Practice and Teach EBM". Edinburgh: Churchill Livingstone.  “EBM is nothing more than a process of life-long, self-directed learning in which caring for patients creates the need for clinically important information about diagnosis, prognosis, therapy, and other clinical and health care issues .” -- The EBM Working Group  EBM is… “ an evolutionary progression of knowledge based on the basic and clinical sciences and facilitated by the age of information technology . ” -- Doherty, Steve. "Evidence-based medicine: Arguments for and Against." Emergency Medicine Australasia 2005; 17: 307-13.         EBM is a Process     Evidence Based Medicine is a process of life-long, problem-based learning.  The process involves:   Converting information needs into focused questions.  Efficiently tracking down the best evidence with which to answer the question.  Critically appraising the evidence for validity and clinical usefulness.  Applying the results in clinical practice.  Evaluating the performance of the evidence in clinical application.          Introduction to EBM     Please feel free to view this introductory lecture, which provides history, definitions, and general background information that is helpful when first learning about evidence based medicine.           EBM or EBP?     Throughout this guide we have chosen to use the phrase 'Evidence-Based Medicine' or 'EBM'.  We acknowledge that many health care professionals prefer the more encompassing terminology of 'Evidence-Based Practice' or 'EBP'. We hope that this guide is helpful to everyone interested in evidence based health care.          Leaders in EBM     Several groups have been leaders in Evidence Based Medicine. Their initiatives in promoting the practice of EBM are numerous and are detailed in various sections of this guide.    Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)     more...  less...   AHRQ's mission is to produce evidence to make health care safer, higher quality, more accessible, equitable, and affordable, and to work within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and with other partners to make sure that the evidence is understood and used.    Centre for Evidence Based Medicine     more...  less...   CEBM aims to develop, teach and promote evidence-based health care through a variety of methods so that all healthcare professionals can maintain the highest standards of medicine.    University of York - Centre for Reviews and Dissemination    more...  less...   A research department that specialises in evidence synthesis, assembling and analysing data from multiple research studies to generate policy relevant research.    Health Information Research Unit-- McMaster University     more...  less...   HIRU's mission is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of health care by providing innovative evidence-based information products and systems to health professionals, patients, policy makers, and the public.  See McMaster Plus for EBM alert services.    Joanna Briggs Institute     more...  less...   The JBI considers evidence-based healthcare as decision-making that considers the feasibility, appropriateness, meaningfulness and effectiveness of healthcare practices. The best available evidence, the context in which care is delivered, the individual patient and the professional judgement and expertise of the health professional inform this process.
