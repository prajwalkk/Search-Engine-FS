These telescopes for high-dimensional data combine powerful statistical methods with user-controlled interfaces. Users can begin with an overview, zoom in on areas of interest, filter out unwanted items, and then click for details-on-demand. With careful design and efficient algorithms, the dynamic queries approach to data exploration can provide 100msec updates even for million-item visualizations that can represent billion-record databases.  This talk reviews the growing commercial success stories such as www.spotfire.com, and www.smartmoney.com/marketmap, plus emerging products such as www.hivegroup.com will be covered.  The central theme is the integration of statistics with visualization as applied for time series data such as (www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/timesearcher ), temporal event sequences such as electronic health records (www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/lifelines2 and www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/eventflow), and social network data (www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/socialaction and www.codeplex.com/nodexl).       Bio:   Ben Shneiderman is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Founding Director (1983-2000) of the Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory at the University of Maryland.? He is a Fellow of the AAAS, ACM, and IEEE, and a Member of the National Academy of Engineering.?  Ben is the co-author with Catherine Plaisant of Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer Interaction (5th ed., 2010). With Stu Card and Jock Mackinlay, he co-authored Readings in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think (1999). ?With Ben Bederson he co-authored The Craft of Information Visualization (2003).
