Exchange programs give students the chance to study at a university outside of the United States and "in exchange" give a student from that university a chance to study at UIC.  Outgoing Exchange Students from UIC  Exchanges provide a full immersion experience. In most cases, exchange students take classes with students from the host country and have the opportunity to get involved in campus clubs, organizations, and activities.  Exchanges are most appropriate for an independent and highly motivated student looking for a fully immersive study abroad experience. Students who choose this option are expected to adapt to what is often a different, more autonomous educational structure, and is therefore best suited for students with a strong academic history.  As with all study abroad programs, exchange participants are required to take a full- time course load while abroad. Some exchanges have a limited number of placements and can be quite competitive. In the Program Search database, scroll down to the Exchange Partners window under Parameters . Highlight all the exchanges except for the “ Any ” option, and click search at the bottom for a list of exchange programs.  For exchange programs, students will pay UIC tuition and fees just like a semester or summer term on campus in Chicago. Additional costs include housing, international insurance, air fare, and personal expenses. Because of this cost structure, exchanges are often ideal for students who have a UIC tuition waiver and for those who are eligible for Veterans Affairs education benefits.  Incoming Exchange Students to UIC  For information on nomination deadlines and the application process, please visit the Office of International Services page.  If your institution is not an exchange partner and you would still like to study at UIC, please visit the International Admissions page for more information.            © Copyright 2014-2020 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois      Footer Navigation                    Vice Provost for Global Engagement  Office of External Scholarships  Office of Financial Aid  University Registrar  Centers for Diversity  Disability Resources  Privacy Policy  Contact Us          Translate » co      Cookie Settings
