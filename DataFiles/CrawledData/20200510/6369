As a prestigious University and College of Medicine, we aim to recruit the best candidates for our medical school, so it is important for us to find ways to limit the potential debt burden and not have cost be an obstacle to a high quality education. As a state institution, we have an in-state tuition rate that is lower than our private peer schools in the area. Most students enrolling in the College of Medicine rely primarily on financial aid to fund their medical school education. Our Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) will work with students individually to try to make the process of funding their education as free from stress as possible.
