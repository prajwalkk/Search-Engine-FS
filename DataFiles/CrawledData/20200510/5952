Our OJS is called Journals@UIC .  Journals can be developed in this open access environment, or existing journals can be moved to this environment and become open access. The OJS software allows editors to manage the journal and its content from the author submission stage to publishing the content in an open access environment.  To discuss developing a new open access journal, or moving an existing journal to Journals@UIC, please contact:  Sandy De Groote Scholarly Communication Librarian sgroote@uic.edu    ROAAP Fund  The UIC Research Open Access Publishing Fund supports faculty, researchers, staff, post-docs, and students who want to make their journal articles free to all readers immediately upon publication, but are not supported by grants or contracts with funds to help cover open access or paid access publishing fees.   Learn more about the ROAAP fund   Preserve Rights to Your Own Work  Do not automatically sign the publisher's "Copyright Transfer Agreement." Use the Addendum To Publication Agreements For CIC Authors (.doc) when you submit a publication to a publisher.   Learn more about author's rights     Institutional Memberships  The UIC Library supports several open access initiatives by providing author discounts for open access publishing.

The fulfillment of this promise will be determined, however, by the choices researchers and scholars make today about where and how they publish. The below brochure outlines some of the issues related to disseminating eScholarship; identifies ways faculty can effectively manage the rights to and dissemination of their work; and describes resources and services available to the UIC community for managing, sharing, promoting, and measuring impact of scholarship and the underlying data.
