UIC Chancellor's Innovation Fund            Home  Projects  Contacts     The UIC Chancellor’s Innovation Fund (CIF) Proof of Concept Awards program awards up to $200,000 per project over two phases to advance technology originating at UIC.  The CIF has been established at UIC by the Office of the Chancellor in partnership with Illinois Ventures and Office of Technology Management to support the commercialization of technology developed by faculty, staff, and students at UIC.    Proof of Concept Awards Program  The POC Awards Program offered through the Chancellor's Innovation Fund is starting a new cycle in Fall 2019. In Phase I, innovators may receive up to $50,000 (Final award amounts will be determined by scope of work of milestones to be completed with the input of the review committees) and have six months to complete a single key milestone. Once complete, the Phase I awardees must submit a final report in order to be considered for Phase II funding where awardees may apply for up to $150,000 in additional funds (Final award amounts will be determined by scope of work of milestones to be completed with the input of the review committees) and have 12 months to complete additional commercially significant milestones. Final awardees for each phase are selected by an external panel of venture capitalists, industry experts, and business leaders.    Process for Fall 2019 Phase I  The upcoming Fall 2019 Phase I CIF POC Awards Program will accept Pre-Proposal submissions between Friday, July 12th and Friday, August 23rd at 5 p.m. CDT. The Pre-Proposal Review Committee will then review and select finalists from the pool of applicants. Finalists will meet with members of Illinois Ventures and the Office of Technology Management for a project planning meeting and mock pitches as they prepare for the full proposal submission in PowerPoint presentation format due Monday,  November 15th, 2019. Finally, the Phase I Program will culminate in a slide presentation to a panel of venture capitalists, business leaders, and industry experts on the Final Pitch Day where the awardees will be selected for funding. Awardees will be notified of the final decision in early December.         2019 Fall POC Awards Program Documents:  UIC Chancellor's Innovation Fund Proof of Concept Awards Program Pre-Proposal Application Form  Instructions for UIC Chancellor's Innovation Fund POC Awards Program Pre-Proposal    2019 Fall POC Awards Program Important Dates:   August 23rd, 2019 - Pre-Proposals Due  Week of October 6th, 2019- POC Finalists Announced  Week of December 8th, 2019 - Final Pitch Day  Week of December 15th, 2019 - POC Winners Announced     UIC Chancellor's Innovation Fund in the News     University of Illinois-Chicago announces $400K in grants from the UIC Chancellor’s Innovation Fund       Awards brings research closer to commercialization       University of Illinois At Chicago, IllinoisVentures Launches New $10M POC/Seed Funds       University Of Illinois At Chicago (UIC) Writes Big Check For Startup Entrepreneurs      UIC launches $10M seed fund to advance startups       © Copyright 2018 UIC Chancellor's Innovation Fund
