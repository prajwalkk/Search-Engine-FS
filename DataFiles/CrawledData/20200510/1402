The FAFSA is available on October 1 each year - UIC’s priority filing deadline is February 15.  FSA ID:  Students and a parent, if applicable, must have a Federal Student Aid ID (login) to sign the electronic FAFSA.  Get your FSA ID online here .  UIC’s School Code: 001776  Include UIC’s school code on the FAFSA - (001776)  Student Dependency Status:  Students are considered dependent or independent based on information provided on the FAFSA. Most undergraduate students are dependent. All graduate and professional students are independent. Dependent students must report parental income information on the FAFSA. Dependency Status is not based on whether a student lives with a parent, is financially self-supportive, or claimed as dependent on a parents’ taxes.  Student Aid Report (SAR):  After receiving a FAFSA, the Federal Processor will send a Student Aid Report (SAR) electronically. The SAR lists all information submitted on the FAFSA and explains the EFC calculation. Review the SAR for accuracy and log on to the FAFSA website to make corrections.
