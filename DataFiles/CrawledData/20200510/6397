In the early 1970s, when the U.S. government authorized funding for major universities in select states to deliver regionalized healthcare education, the UIC College of Nursing in Chicago was ready. With a plan and a purpose, we promptly opened programs in Urbana and Peoria (1972), followed shortly by Quad Cities (1980). We expanded to Rockford in 1991, and opened our newest campus, in Springfield , in 2016.  Today students at all six campuses enjoy the same highly ranked education, the same world-class faculty and the same esteemed degrees from the UIC College of Nursing.      Quote on value of regions    The campuses beyond Chicago inform UIC Nursing education overall because they add suburban and rural perspectives to the urban perspective that’s natural to UIC. It’s a diversity that enriches the education of every student.
