if you need admin access, ask an admin to add you as an admin.  If there are no more admins around, I would email consult@uic.edu, and ask for it.  They might require a faculty member make the request.   http://www.lsoft.com/manuals/16.0/htmlhelp/site%20managers/LSCommands.html    acm-announce    https://acm.cs.uic.edu/cgi-bin/mailman/admin/acm-announce   by default, everyone joins this list as moderated, meaning they cannot post to the list.  if you need to be un-moderated, go to https://acm.cs.uic.edu/cgi-bin/mailman/admin/acm-announce/members , find your email address, and make sure the mod column is unchecked . You can also select the option to add a sender to the Accept list/remove their mod flag when approving an email that has been blocked for moderator approval.   acm-officers   A private list for ACM's officers. It is open for anyone to email, emails are sent to acm-officers@uic.edu.      mailing_lists.txt · Last modified: 2016/02/15 15:43 by walter      Page Tools    Show pagesource Old revisions Backlinks Back to top        Except where otherwise noted, content on this wiki is licensed under the following license: CC Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 4.0 International
