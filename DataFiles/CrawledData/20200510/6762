We encourage you to learn more about our position(s), department, and campus community to discover if UIC is the best fit for you to call home! Go Flames!  As the largest institution of higher learning in the Chicago area, UIC is the hub for more than 31,000 students, with 3,800 living on-campus. UIC embodies the qualities of a large, diverse, urban institution, located just west of Chicago's loop, nestled in historic residential neighborhoods and the urban environment. Having nearly doubled in size in the past ten years Campus Housing seeks to develop students both in and out of the classroom through active student involvement in the university's mission. We strive to ensure that living on-campus provides students an educational advantage, which engages students in their own learning and contributes to their overall success at UIC.  UIC is currently seeing record enrollment growth and is serving an increasingly diverse student population, placing among the top 15 ethnically diverse national universities. UIC moved up in the annual “Best Colleges” rankings published by U.S. News & World Report — climbing to 61 from 73 among top public schools in the nation, and rising to 129 from 145 among all national universities. Our students have the opportunity to engage with incredibly talented faculty, staff, and peers over their time at UIC. A campus initially designed to serve a large commuter population is quickly becoming one where residence life plays a vital role in defining campus culture.  In fall 2019, we are proud to be opening a new student housing community slated to be one of the leading mixed-use, living-learning communities in the country. Housing over 530 students, this project reinforces our commitment to supporting the growth, recruitment, retention, and graduation of our students. Learn more about the ARC here .
