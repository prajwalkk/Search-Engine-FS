Our staff has experience with a variety of computing architectures, commercial/open-source software and programming languages.    Scientific Instrument Shop  The Scientific Instrument Shop (SIS) is staffed by instrument Makers, laboratory Mechanics, Biomedical Electronics Engineers and Biomedical Electronics Technicians who construct and repair all types of mechanical and electronic/electrical equipment for the research, teaching and clinical requirements of faculty, staff, students and other RRC services.     Scientific Storeroom  We carry a wide variety of items for the research lab, ranging from molecular biology reagents to office supplies.     UI Health Biorepository  The biorepository acquires, stores, catalogues, processes, analyzes, and provides tissue or other biological samples for investigators at UIC. It was established in 2012 as a resource in the UI Health system in collaboration with the RRC to augment clinical and translational research and improve the treatment and health of individuals from Chicago, Illinois, and beyond. The facility manages a centralized, secure, and 24/7-monitored freezer farm for biological storage, a centralized lab facility for processing and analysis, and the acquisition of biospecimens through PI-initiated studies. Any biospecimens remaining after analysis from PI-initiated studies can then be used for any unspecified future use, if approved by a research oversight board. An Honest Broker is on staff to help with control and access of patient information.
