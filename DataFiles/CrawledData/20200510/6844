Within a short distance from UIC, one can try tzatziki in Greek Town, cannolis in Little Italy, or meat dumplings in Chinatown. Sports lovers can take in a Chicago Bulls basketball game or Chicago Blackhawks hockey match at the United Center right around the corner, or check out a game with one of the other title winning Chicago sports teams. And with a short ride on the CTA Blue Line train, a visitor to Chicago can gain access to downtown’s cultural pursuits, such as Broadway in Chicago and The Art Institute of Chicago, or one can travel outside of downtown to the artistic streets and food of Pilsen or the improv and storefront theater culture on the North Side. Music lovers in Chicago also have a wide variety of choices, from seeing orchestral music performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra to visiting one of the many well respected jazz and blues clubs that exist in nearly every neighborhood within the city.
