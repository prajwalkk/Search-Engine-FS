Concerned with social justice, her research focuses on how the social world becomes embodied and expressed as health, illness or suffering.  As a global health researcher, Patil uses ecological and social determinants frameworks to make sense of complex health-related problems. She applies these models as she develops and tests strategies to reduce health disparities and strengthen health systems both in the United States and in sub-Saharan Africa.  With funding from the National Institutes of Health, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the National Science Foundation and others, Patil has published 48 papers in top-tier national and international journals, and she has delivered numerous presentations at international conferences. In addition, she has received recognition from her peers through several awards and honors including the Fellow of the Year Award from the UIC Honors College; Dedication and Support Award from the Have a Heart for Sickle Cell Anemia Foundation; and the Eleanor Roosevelt Global Citizenship Award from the Center for Public Anthropology.
