Librarians work with UIC faculty to create sessions relevant to course assignments such as research papers. We are available to meet with your students in your classroom, online or in our teaching labs for hands-on research instruction tailored to student needs.      What types of activities or lessons can librarians provide?  Example topics can include:   Evaluating search results from Google, Google Scholar and library databases  Discerning the differences between various publication types in print and electronic format  Constructing effective searches for research topics  Searching library databases and Google Scholar for articles  Searching library catalogs for books, ordering books from other libraries        Request instruction    Name      Email      Phone      Course title and number      Subject area     Humanities, social sciences, science, math or engineering     Special collections and university archives     Health sciences (Chicago)     Health sciences (Peoria or Quad Cities)     Health sciences (Rockford)     Health sciences (Springfield or Urbana)     Law (John Marshall Law School)        How many sessions do you need?
