Our educational program is designed to serve a variety of career choices, allowing students to prepare for careers in medical practice, research, teaching, community medicine, and various disciplines of medical practice. Additionally, emphasis is placed on developing an attitude that’s necessary for effective communication with individual patients, and society at large. The curriculum stresses rational decision making and clinical problem solving based on an understanding of the basic biological, physical, and behavioral sciences; thus the integration of basic and clinical sciences is emphasized throughout the program. Residencies The College of Medicine at Rockford also offers a residency program in family medicine that has become known for its training for both ambulatory and hospital care, with a particular emphasis in obstetrics. Standardized Patient Program The Standardized Patient (SP) program at the College of Medicine utilizes individuals specially trained by health professionals to simulate patients in a variety of scenarios encountered in medical practice. SPs are instructed in how to assess student performance, which helps to ensure that students have the opportunity to learn and be evaluated in a standardized way. They can provide valuable feedback about students’ communication, physical exam and medical decision-making skills to both students and faculty.
