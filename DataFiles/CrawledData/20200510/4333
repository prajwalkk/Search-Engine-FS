Preprofessional advisors who specialize in pre-health and pre-law advising are able to assist students in pursuing programs in the following areas:   Pre-Dentistry  Pre-Health Information Management  Pre-Law  Pre-Medicine (M.D./D.O. and podiatric medicine)  Pre-Nursing  Pre-Nutrition  Pre-Occupational Therapy  Pre-Optometry  Pre-Pharmacy  Pre-Physical Therapy  Pre-Physician Assistant  Pre-Public Health  Pre-Veterinary Medicine.   Preprofessional advisors are available to meet with students during individual appointment sessions and group workshops. On-demand webinars are also available for students interested in pre-health fields. Students interested in preprofessional studies should visit the LAS Pre-Health website or the LAS Pre-Law website for information regarding webinars, upcoming workshops, and other related information. Students can also find information regarding how to schedule an appointment with a pre-health  or pre-law advisor.  Preprofessional studies in Pre-Dentistry, Pre-Law, Pre-Medicine, Pre-Occupational Therapy, Pre-Optometry, Pre-Physical Therapy, Pre-Physician Assistant, and Pre-Veterinary Medicine require students to complete an undergraduate degree program, including a major and prerequisite course work. In most cases, the bachelor’s degree is required prior to matriculation to the professional program. If admitted, students complete a professional degree program and graduate with a post-baccalaureate professional degree.  Preprofessional studies in Pre-Health Information Management, Pre-Nutrition, Pre-Nursing, and Pre-Public Health require students to complete at least two years of undergraduate study prior to admission to a different UIC college. In some instances, completion of a particular program may take more time than anticipated if the student needs to satisfy prerequisites, or when a student does not take courses in the proper sequence. If admitted, students complete at least two additional years of undergraduate study in the program and graduate with a bachelor’s degree.  Preprofessional study in Pre-Pharmacy requires students to complete a minimum of two years of undergraduate study prior to admission to the College of Pharmacy. In most cases, three years of undergraduate study are needed to complete the prerequisite course work. A majority of the students admitted to the College of Pharmacy have completed a bachelor’s degree at the time of matriculation. If admitted, students complete four additional years of study in the UIC College of Pharmacy and graduate with a doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) degree.  Completion of prerequisite course work does not guarantee admission to a professional college or program. Students pursuing preprofessional studies are strongly encouraged to consult an LAS preprofessional advisor and an advisor in the professional program before submitting an application. Each professional program has specific application procedures, deadlines, and requirements, which can change from time to time and may not be reflected in this catalog. Students are responsible for obtaining the most current information.  Students pursuing preprofessional studies must plan their course of study with care. Advisors are available to assist students, however, the responsibility for selecting courses and meeting admission requirements rests with the individual student who must plan and select courses consistent with the program requirements. The information below provides the current prerequisite course information for the UIC or UIUC professional programs. LAS Preprofessional advisors can assist students in applying to programs outside of UIC as well.
