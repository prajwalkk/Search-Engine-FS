Programs with a Specialized Process    Programs utilizing a Centralized Application Service (CAS) review CAS application records independently from the Office of Admissions. Please be sure to monitor your status within the respective CAS portal. Institutional receipt of CAS records by Admissions will be noted through our application system after the completed CAS application record has been noted as mailed or verified by the service. There will be a delay, however, the program’s review of your application is not affected. Any institutional requirements missing after receipt of the finalized CAS record (such as application fees and foreign academic credentials) will be requested to be submitted/uploaded through the checklist.           Doctor of Medicine Applicants    Applicants of the Doctor of Medicine (MD) program cannot view their institutional application record on-line through the UIC Office of Admissions site. Please refer to instructions provided by the College of Medicine to obtain information concerning your application, as MD admission is handled entirely by the college.
