In some cases, internships may also give the student an opportunity to make a significant contribution to a local organization through sharing their expertise.  Each partner has contacts with a range of professionals, businesses, non-government organizations for the most relevant placement.  Some common placements have included: small business, large companies, media & communication; language teaching, not-for-profit volunteer organizations, tourism, arts & arts administration, journalism, museums & galleries, social outreach, and theater.  Below are hyperlinks to program partners that offer unpaid internships abroad. All internships are credit bearing through an academic component and are fully integrated into the curriculum of a study abroad program. Some may require a minimum level of local language skill and all require the student to be flexible to local conditions and working norms.
