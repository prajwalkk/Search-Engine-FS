Policies that are developed through the UIC Policy on Policies process are non-educational and have broad application across the university, i.e., affect more than one major college or administrative unit. The two additional criteria that define university-level policies are that they:   Advance compliance with applicable laws and regulations, promote operational efficiencies, enhance the university's mission, or reduce institutional risks; and  Mandate action or restraint with procedures for compliance.   Of the policies that meet this definition, many are owned by units such as UIC Human Resources, Faculty Affairs, or ACCC. One example is Employment of Relatives , a UIC Human Resources policy.  Policies vs. Procedures . A policy must meet the criteria noted in the definition above. A procedure is a statement that outlines, often in a step-by-step fashion, how a policy will be implemented and by whom. The Committee on Policy approves policies, but not procedures. Procedures are developed by the unit that owns the policy. This allows the unit to update its procedures on a regular basis without having to return to the Committee for approval.       What is the process for developing a new university-level policy?   UIC has established a standardized process for the development, approval, and oversight of official university-level policies. The process is in place to ensure that these policies have a consistent format, are formally approved, widely communicated, centrally maintained, and readily available for review.   Start the process by filling out the Policy needs assessment form.  Send that form to the Office of the Provost for administrative review.  After clearing the administrative review, the policy will then continue through the policy development process outlined in the flowchart.     Read more about the policy development process .         What is the process for transferring an existing university-level policy to the Policy on Policies template?    Transfer your existing policy to the Policy template and send it to the Office of the Provost for administrative review.  Instructions for filling out the template are outlined on the Policy development template with instructions .  After clearing the administrative review, the policy will then follow the expedited approval process and will be considered by the Committee on Policy .        Where can I find a list of all university-level policies?   Search for policies in the UIC Policy Library . Policies will be added to the library as the Office of the Provost works collaboratively with responsible units to approve new policies and transfer existing policies to the Policy on Policies template. Units that own specific policies are encouraged to post those policies on their websites as well, together with the procedures that are related to implementation of those policies.  When a new policy is approved or an existing policy is transferred to the Policy on Policies template, the policy owner will notify all impacted parties. In addition, the updated policy or new policy will also be posted in the Announcements section of the Policy on Policies website.    Explore the Policy Library.    View the Announcements section.         Who do I contact if I have questions?   The Office of the Provost is responsible for oversight of the policy development process and catalogs university-level policies on its website.
