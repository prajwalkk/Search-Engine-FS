Once you activate your UIC NetID and password, use it to access most authenticated University of Illinois computing and networking services (e.g., Self-Service Enterprise applications like Student Registration & Records, Financial Aid) as well as UIC campus-based services like email, Blackboard, Wifi and computer labs.  One NetID. One Password. Your new NetID is a unique identifier assigned to you. It becomes part of your UIC email address ( NetID@uic.edu ) and is your login name for these services.  A secure and well-managed password is key to protecting your access to University of Illinois computing resources. The activation process includes setting up password recovery options for self-service management so that you will be prepared, in advance, if you need to recover your password.
