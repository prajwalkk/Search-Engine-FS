Through three fields of inquiry—sociocultural anthropology, biological anthropology, and archaeology—UIC anthropology provides a holistic approach to understanding human cultures and societies from prehistory to the present.  By providing contemporary perspectives on culture and society,  it prepares students to understand the complex problems and challenges posed by a globalized society and economy. Through explorations of the complex relationship between culture and biology, biological anthropology prepares students to think about how cultural understandings, social experiences and positions, and health are intertwined.  Archaeology extends these understandings into the past, excavating the deep relationship between human history, prehistory, and the present. The expertise of the faculty affords students the opportunity to pursue interests in most of the major time periods and geographic areas of the world.  An undergraduate education in anthropology provides valuable preparation for many careers that involve working with individuals of diverse national or ethnic backgrounds. Undergraduate majors have found careers in global public health, healthcare services, social case work, cultural resource management, museum education, public housing, employment and personnel counseling, public office, the Peace Corps, field archaeology, import businesses, market research, the Foreign Service, and social and environmental planning. Anthropology majors are also well positioned to continue their education, not only to be career anthropologists, but to enter professions such as computer programming, law, medicine, business, urban planning, nonprofit management, and public administration.  Distinction in Anthropology  To be considered for distinction, a candidate must have a 3.00/4.00 cumulative GPA and meet all the requirements for a major in Anthropology, plus the following:   3.50/4.00 GPA in the major for Distinction  3.75/4.00 GPA in the major for High Distinction  3.75/4.00 GPA in the major and satisfactorily complete a thesis in ANTH 390 for Highest Distinction. This course involves the preparation of an honors research paper, under the supervision of a faculty member of the student’s choosing, and its acceptance by a three-member honors committee especially constituted for this purpose.
