Congressional Research Service      CRS Reports from Congress  These documents were prepared by the Congressional Research Service (CRS). CRS serves as nonpartisan shared staff to congressional committees and Members of Congress. It operates solely at the behest of and under the direction of Congress. Information in a CRS Report should not be relied upon for purposes other than public understanding of information that has been provided by CRS to Members of Congress in connection with CRS’s institutional role. CRS Reports, as a work of the United States Government, are not subject to copyright protection in the United States. Any CRS Report may be reproduced and distributed in its entirety without permission from CRS. However, as a CRS Report may include copyrighted images or material from a third party, you may need to obtain the permission of the copyright holder if you wish to copy or otherwise use copyrighted material.    Every CRS Report  We’re publishing reports by Congress’s think tank, the Congressional Research Service, which provides valuable insight and non-partisan analysis of issues of public debate. These reports are already available to the well-connected — we’re making them available to everyone for free.    Open Congressional Research Service  Congressional Research Service is a "think tank" that provides reports to members of Congress on a variety of topics relevant to current political events.              << Previous: Library Databases Next: Executive Branch Information >>          Last Updated:  Mar 16, 2020 2:18 PM    URL:  https://researchguides.uic.edu/gov    Print Page     Staff Login        Subjects:  Government Information , Reference & Interdisciplinary , Social Sciences    Tags:  daley                   Logo for the University of Illinois at Chicago       University  Library          Locations          Richard J.
