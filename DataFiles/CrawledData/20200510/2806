In rare instances, document conversion may take longer than two weeks; in these cases the DRC will be in contact with the student and their instructor about timeline.  Once requested materials are ready for use, they will either be uploaded to your Kurzweil Universal Library or sent to you via the UIC cloud platform, Box. For a tutorial on setting up a Box account for the first time, follow this link: Link to Box Set-Up Instructions.
