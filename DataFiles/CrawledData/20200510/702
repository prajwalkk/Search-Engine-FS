Products that have been co-designed by the Institute for Healthcare Delivery Design and our organizational partners are now available for download on our products page under a Creative Commons license.  Designing for the real-world context of care. We look beyond clinical settings to understand the day-to-day experiences of people living with medical conditions. Combining healthcare delivery science and human-centered design deepens our understanding of the contexts and reality of care and helps us progress from discovery to practice.             We strive for impact. We work in four areas: Healthcare organizations are invited to work with the Institute for Healthcare Delivery Design. You can engage in the following ways:              Learn to identify gaps in care delivery and propose new clinical questions. Our point of view is that the progression from discovery science to practice is missing a people-centered component that ties research to the realities of patients’ lived experiences. As a result, we focus on the translation of proven interventions to practice.         Hire us to run a design-led project to gain insight into how your organization delivers care and how it aligns with patients’ experiences. A range of collaborative advisory services are available to organizations seeking to better understand stakeholders' experiences, identify areas for potential innovation, improve quality of existing practices, or looking for new perspective on persistent challenges.         Introduce your team to design methods for healthcare delivery in a one-day workshop or an extended program. Professional education programs in design methods for healthcare delivery enable organizations to build competency and confidence to take on care innovation initiatives.         Join practitioners from other organizations to learn new approaches, gain exposure to new ideas, and build your network. We bring all parties to the table to learn about the latest new approaches to care delivery. We assess how they align with the knowledge and experience of healthcare professionals and others interacting with the healthcare system.   Projects bring focus to the entire network of stakeholders involved in the delivery of patient care. Our work is an interdisciplinary collaboration with partners at UIC, in the City of Chicago, the State of Illinois, and across the United States.

Designing Healthcare Solutions for the Real World Kim Erwin and Jerry Krishnan, co-directors for the Institute for Healthcare Delivery Design at the University of Illinois Chicago, talk with Seth Starner from Steelcase to share how healthcare design is returning healthcare to its roots—helping patients, families and clinicians do the right thing.       Stories                       How do Community Health Workers bridge asthma care gaps?          "If giving everyone the same thing would make a difference, then everyone would be ok. But some people need more things than others." Community Health Workers meet people where they are and pick up where clinics leave off.                             A Day In the Life of a Community Health Worker          A Community Health Worker can provide tailored patient education, address environmental factors, and observe comorbid conditions in ways that emergency departments + outpatient clinics can’t.                             The not-so-incidental costs of pregnancy care          To understand how we might design cost conversations for a high-risk OB/GYN patient population and their providers, our research team talked to 24 doctors, nurses and staff working in three OB/GYN clinics on Chicago’s South Side. We also talked to 20 pregnant or newly post-partum women who are served by these clinics.                             10 Common Roadblocks to Caring for a Child with Asthma in Chicago          A story of a child having an asthma attack told by a community health worker.
