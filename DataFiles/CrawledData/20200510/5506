Copyright and Permissions  When working with outside photographers, make sure that all contracts specify that UIC will own exclusive rights to the use of the images. This will allow the images to be used for current and future projects without having to purchase additional rights.  Photo Release  Other than those photographed for news coverage by independent news organizations, any individuals who may be identified by their image must sign a photo release form before they are photographed for a UIC project. The release gives UIC permission to use the photo in any university communication vehicle or any outside medium used to represent the campus. It acknowledges that the signatory understands that the information may be published and shown in public and that there will be no compensation provided for its use.  The law requires that subjects under 18 years of age have a parent or guardian sign their consent. Download a photo consent form .  Note: Obtaining a completed consent form is the responsibility of the project manager, not the photographer, unless specified in the contract or business agreement.  Much more restrictive federal privacy laws apply—with severe penalties for their violation—to the depiction of patients. News media must not be allowed into patient care areas or put in contact with patients except under the mediation of the UIC News Bureau. Contact the News Bureau to obtain an Authorization for Release of Patient Information for Publication or Broadcast form.       Video branding guidelines   All UIC videos should follow the Guidelines on UIC branding for videos . There are separate guidelines for the seven Health Sciences which should adhere to co-branding guidelines set by PGA and VCHA, which use the co-branded logo with a short statement at the end of each video.
