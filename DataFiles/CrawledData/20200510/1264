Shibboleth Identity Provider is centrally maintained to provide SAML compliant authentication services. These services limit reuse and exposure to user credentials by multiple services.  Shibboleth can be used to allow access to your application to any Organization on the Internet that supports SAML. Conversely, it can also be used to allow UIC users access to third-party applications that support SAML using their UIC credentials.

This will allow the user’s web scripts to authenticate users, using their normal UIC NetID and password, in a very secure manner.           More Info     When one uses an online service, there are two primary actions associated with access:   Authentication verifies who you are and is the act of ensuring that the person with the credential (login id for example) is the same person that the organization has on file as having permission to use that credential. The verification is done using a password or some other mechanism.  Authorization is about what you can do and is the act of granting access to the authenticated individual based on role, organizational affiliation, and the like.   If a cloud service requires authentication to UIC Active Directory, a UIC employee needs to request shibboleth integration to authenticate UIC users and grant access. It is preferred that the third-party application be registered with the InCommon Federation to prevent disruptions when changes occur with the identity provider information.
