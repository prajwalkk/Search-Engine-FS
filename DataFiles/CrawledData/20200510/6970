If you do not have access to a computer or  printer, visit a UIC computer lab .  To complete your check-in, visit OIS and bring the following documents:   passport,  visa,  I-20, DS-2019 or your approval notice of current status,  I-94 card (white card inside passport or printout available here ),  I-901 SEVIS fee receipt (F-1 & J-1 students only, printout available here )  copy of your insurance (J-1 students only, see below for more on health insurance requirements)   OIS will make a copy of these documents for your file and, within 24 business hours, release the SEVIS hold on your student account. This will allow  you to register for classes. You must be registered for full-time in your first semester of your program, including summer.  For students with immigration documents sponsored by UIC, failure to  check-in within 30 days of the start of classes will result in  termination of your nonimmigrant status.  Medical Insurance Policy Requirements for J-1 Students  In addition to Campus Care, J-1 Exchange Visitors (students) and  their J-2 dependents must have health insurance that meets the minimum  requirements as defined by the U.S. Department of State, at all times  during the J program. Most J-1 students will need to purchase  supplemental insurance to include medical evacuation and repatriation. Please see the J-1 insurance section of our website for additional information. Proof of insurance will need to be provided to OIS upon Check-in.    xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
