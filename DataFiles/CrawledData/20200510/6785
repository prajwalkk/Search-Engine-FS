However, you are responsible for determining if you are in the proper course. An instructor may advise you to change courses if you have registered for an inappropriate level. The placement test is also available as an option for students who would like to take it. If you have any questions, please call the Summer Session Office at (312) 996-9099.  If you receive a “Placement Test or Prerequisite Error” while registering for a course, contact us for assistance.  Note: If you have been admitted to UIC in the fall, you may be required to take placement tests in order to register for fall courses. Please contact your college for more information.
