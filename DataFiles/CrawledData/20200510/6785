All visiting students, including UIUC and UIS students, must apply to UIC and be admitted as a nondegree student for the summer term only before they can register for courses. As a UIUC/UIS student, you have two different types of applications available to you depending on whether or not you plan to use summer financial aid. Please note that previous applicants need to apply again.   + I have financial aid – Intercampus Registration.  If you would like to use financial aid during UIC’s Summer Session, you will apply through a process called Intercampus Registration . Please contact your financial aid advisor at your home campus to determine if you have financial aid available for the summer. Make sure to follow your home campus summer financial aid deadlines and policies. Intercampus Registration is done using a paper form and requires your college dean’s signature but has no fee.    + I do not plan on using financial aid – Summer Session Only.  If you do not have financial aid that you wish to use over the summer, you should apply as a Summer Session Only student . If you use this application, you will not be eligible for any summer financial aid.  The Summer Session Only application is submitted online and normally requires an application fee, but this fee has been waived for the 2020 Summer Session.  If you are not using financial aid, and also fall into the categories below, you may have additional steps to follow:     + I’m starting/applying at UIC in the fall.  If you have already applied or been admitted to UIC in the upcoming fall semester as a transfer or graduate student , but want to take undergraduate courses during the preceding summer, you will need to select a summer application and apply by the application deadline . If you still plan to apply as a degree-seeking student for the fall, visit the Office of Admissions for more information.  Note for fall incoming students – Even if you attend Summer Session, you will still need to submit your Intent to Enroll  for the fall semester by the Intent to Enroll deadline. Also, once you’ve completed your summer course(s), you may need to petition your college to transfer the credits into your UIC degree program. If you have questions about which course to take in summer, consult a UIC advisor.    + I’m an international student.

If you already have an undergraduate degree, but want to take undergraduate courses in preparation for applying to professional degree programs, you can apply as a Summer Session Only student  by the application deadline .    + I’m interested in graduate-level summer courses.  If you are interested in taking graduate level courses at UIC over the summer, use the Graduate Application . Check for the appropriate Graduate Application deadline . If you have any questions regarding the Graduate Application, contact the Office of Admissions by phone at (312) 996-4350.  The regular Graduate Application fee does apply.
