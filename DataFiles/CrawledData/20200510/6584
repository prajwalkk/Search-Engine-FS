It outlines the entire Community Standards Process and provides potential sanctions you could receive. Make sure you know and understand the specific alleged violations against you, which are listed in your notice of complaint letter and defined in the Student Code of Conduct. Your understanding of this Policy could directly affect your perception and approach towards your upcoming community standards hearing. When in doubt, contact the Office of the Dean of Students for clarification at 312-996-4857.  Be Prompt Plan to arrive at your hearing before the Community Standards Committee at least 15 minutes prior to the scheduled time. This will allow you an opportunity to collect your thoughts before presenting your case and to ask any final questions about the process. All hearings begin on time. The dress code for any hearing is casual.  Bring an Advisor In most cases, an advisor is not necessary but you have the right to bring one. An advisor can help you prepare for your hearing and may sit with you during the hearing. Advisors can be any trusted individual, including parents, friends, attorneys and especially faculty and staff who are familiar with the Community Standards Process. It is important to remember that our process is student led and educationally based. This means you are responsible for representing yourself in the hearing. Your advisor will not be allowed to speak on your behalf or appear in your stead. Remember, you must notify the Office of the Dean of Students with your advisor’s name and phone number at least five business days prior to your hearing. Failure to do so could result in your advisor not be allowed in the proceedings or your hearing could be rescheduled.  Bring Witnesses Like advisors, witnesses are not necessary in most cases. Witnesses are useful when only second-hand information is available. Witnesses can present relevant information about an incident as they saw or heard it themselves. We do not allow for character witnesses. You must notify the Office of the Dean of Students of any witnesses prior to the hearing.  Be Prepared & Organized Be sure to organize all of your thoughts and outline all of the events associated with the incident. Taking the time to write out a thorough opening and closing statement would help to present your side of the incident clearly. It is essential that you read through your case packet from the Office of the Dean of Students when you are notified of your upcoming hearing. This packet contains relevant information that will be presented and discussed at your hearing. Being organized and prepared for your hearing increases the chances of a fair and agreeable outcome.  Ask Questions – Early & Often  The Community Standards Process is about student development and growth. The Office of the Dean of Students is designed to assist you during this process. Be sure to get all of your questions answered prior to your hearing and do not hesitate to follow up.
