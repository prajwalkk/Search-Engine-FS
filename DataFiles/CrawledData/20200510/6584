Running Mates: Wasan Kumar for President & Jocelyn Bravo for Student Trustee         House of Representatives       Dahlya H. El-adawe  MY NAME IS DAHLYA H. EL-ADAWE, AND I AM RUNNING FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT GOVERNMENT’S HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. BELOW ARE 
THE PILLARS OF MY CAMPAIGN;
Representation: All of the students at UIC are multi-faceted and intersectional. I am running to ensure that this university does not cater towards a specific facet of its students, and every student sees themselves reflected in the University. Inclusion: UIC boasts itself to be the most diverse campus in the nation. However, a diverse campus is not always an inclusive one. I want to work to be able to boast the campus’ inclusivity along with its diversity. 
Transparency: The students’ relationship with faculty and staff has always been a detached one. I hope to be able to make what the faculty and staff are doing to better the UIC campus transparent and attainable to all students.    Michelle Zhou  My name is Michelle Zhou and I am seeking reelection as a USG Representative. As a representative, I aim to make UIC more accessible and inclusive for all students and prospective students, specifically through the implementation of open educational resources. Additionally, I hope to serve as a liaison between students and UIC faculty by advocating for students’ concerns, such as healthier/more inclusive options in the dining halls.    Samprithi Vilvasigamani  I am running for undergraduate house of representatives of the undergraduate student government because I believe there is much about our University that can be changed to increase SAFETY, increase enrollment, solidify retention and dramatically increase the quality of life for both students and faculty alike. As the democratically elected voice of the students at UIC, it is the duty of the student representative to ensure that the thoughts, comments, and questions of the students are relentlessly expressed to the university as a whole. I believe I can meet the burden with confidence.    Bayan Hammad  After being involved in USG for one year, I finallyrealized the impact that representatives could make oncampus and how important it is for us to representstudents faithfully and truthfully. As a representativeof students in the Undergradute Student Governmentat UIC, I am initiating a new project that is focused onbringing student organizations together andconnecting them with USG. I believe it is critical for students on campus to be connected with USG and learn about the kind of work that USG does. It is equally important for USG to create an effective network with student organizations and cultural centers on campus.Together, create welcoming spaces and open doors for communications on a campus that embraces diversity as a top quality!             Student Trustee Candidates       David W. Shipyor  If elected to the position of Student Trustee, I pledge to fully and faithfully represent all students from the Chicago campus on the University of Illinois Board of Trustees.    John C. Donners  My vision for UIC is to bring students the amazing college experience and representation they deserve. I will fight for improved student safety, better mental resources, building improvements, better Wi-Fi, increased real world work experiences across majors, greater commuter resources, Greek life housing on campus, and a more fulfilling college experience overall. I will bring students a university experience that works for them!    Jocelyn Bravo  My name is Jocelyn Bravo and I’m running for Student Trustee to unite:
