Do Not Park in the Bike Lane        Bicycle lanes are legal street designations intended for bicycle traffic only.  The use of these areas for temporary parking is prohibited and carries a penalty of $150.  Vehicles parked in bicycle lanes force bicycle riders into the lane of traffic, creating a dangerous situation for the rider and other drivers.  All UIC staff, faculty and students are strongly urged and cautioned to refrain from parking vehicles in these unauthorized locations. Those who ride bicycles and all pedestrians are likewise advised to observe traffic control devices and crosswalks, and to be alert at all times to their surroundings.          To report a vehicle in a bike lane:  Call the City of Chicago at 311  Call the UIC Police at 312-996-2830          Helpful Tips for Commuting by Bike        Fix-it Stations  If you need more air in your bike tires, you can use a Fix-It Station or visit one of the student centers and borrow a Bike Pump. The student centers also stock Repair Kits. Visit the Manager Service Window on the first floor to rent out a repair kit or bike pump with a valid i-Card. Fix-It stations are located outside SCE near the east and west entrances. There is also a Fix-It Station just outside of the MSB entrance at 835 W.
