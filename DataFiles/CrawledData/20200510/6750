Groups 1-3 Move Out Instructions           Group 4 Move Out Instructions           Written Check-Out Procedures     Adjusted Procedures for Move Out    Residents are not allowed to have a guest come into the residence hall to assist with their move out . One guest may come with a vehicle to assist with loading items, but they must remain outside with the vehicle. It is expected that this guest also observes social distancing guidelines.  Parking management will not be present. 15-minute parking passes will be available at the Front Desk – someone must be present with the vehicle during this time.  Only one person can be in an elevator at any time.  Guests should be in good health. Individuals in the following categories should refrain from helping residents move out:  Older adults  Women who are pregnant  Individuals with serious underlying medical conditions    Roommates are asked to coordinate their return and are discouraged from being in the room at the same time.  Items to bring:  Face coverings/masks are required for both yourself and your guest at all times  Sanitization supplies (ex: wipes, disinfectant, hand sanitizer)  Please bring your own dolly or cart if needed. A limited amount of moving carts are available.    You will have one hour to move your belongings out of your assigned unit.  Make sure to carry your i-card and keys with you at all times during your check-out so that we can minimize lock-outs and issuance of loaner keys.      How Do I Check Out of My Room?    Be aware of your check-out time.  Groups 1 & 4 must sign up for a check-out time. Groups 2 & 3 are assigned a check-out time.  Available check-out times will be limited to allow for social-distancing.  Before making arrangements for assistance in moving with family/friends, confirm your check-out time.    Remove all of your personal belongings from your unit, both in your bedroom and in common areas of the unit. Items left behind will be disposed.  For expediency, you do not need to clean your unit.  We do ask, however, that you remove all trash.  Please note that donation bins/services will not be available during this move out process. Plan to either pack or dispose items prior to your move out.    Close all windows.  Lock your bedroom and unit exterior door upon departure.  Complete your check out at your residence hall’s Front Desk.
