What to Expect as a New Patient  All new patients receive a comprehensive oral health examination where you and your dentist decide the best treatment options.  Your first visit is a screening appointment, where we will assess your overall oral health care needs and determine whether a General Dentist or Advanced Specialty Dentist care option best match your needs. You may also choose to see a Faculty Dentist for your dental care. As an educational institution, appointments can take longer than a typical dental visit.  If you choose to see a student dentist, they will call you to schedule an initial evaluation, after which we will prepare a comprehensive treatment plan for your review and acceptance prior to beginning treatment. The initial evaluation and planning usually takes 2 to 3 visits and may require taking additional x-rays. Once your treatment plan is accepted, the student dentist will schedule your next visits, which typically take 1 to 2 hours.  We are committed to providing safe and effective oral health care in an environment that is compassionate and comfortable in service to our patients.

My issue is connected to a form of arthritis of my jaw joint based on the continued deterioration. It’s been a journey to say the least, but my daily pain level has lessened with much thanks to your team’s excellent care.  In addition to the phenomenal care I’ve received, I also believe not enough dental schools around the country are specializing in TMJ or truly understands the complexities of it as well as Dr. Sahni and her colleagues do. They are good to their patients and training the next generation of students as well.”             “As a veteran, I was referred to UIC from the VA hospital. My dental care at UIC has been fantastic and I’m very satisfied. I’ve gotten so many compliments about my new smile. They replaced my old removal dentures with new implants that feel much better. I definitely made the right choice with UIC.”             " I was long overdue for getting dental work done. I did my homework, and one of the biggest reasons I chose UIC is the educational philosophy they follow. This means a lot to me as an educator myself.”             “UIC is amazing for my kids' dental care. It’s so nice to go to a dentist specifically designed for children. Since we’ve been seeing Laurel, we’ve decided to bring all 3 kids here, even though it’s a 2 hour drive. The communication is fantastic - they explain everything and let you know what they’re going to do, before they do it. As a parent, that makes it easier for me to understand what’s happening with my kids health - I know because I see the difference in my kids reaction to UIC vs. other dentists."             “The biggest reason I chose UIC is the quality of the care, and they work with my insurance.” “As an educator myself, I also want to support the College’s public health mission, and I like having the opportunity to get my care from national leaders in dental knowledge creation – the clinicians and researchers at UIC.”  -- Peter Nelson,  Dean, UIC College of Engineering             Nerve damage during a previous wisdom teeth extraction by another dentist, led Tanya to Dr. Michael Miloro, Professor and Head of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at UIC / UI Health. Dr. Miloro is an internationally recognized expert in trigeminal nerve repair. He performed a repair of the right lingual nerve using a nerve allograft, restoring feeling in her tongue and her ability to taste and eat normally. "The care I received at UI Health was unbelievable! I did not tell anyone I was an employee here, and I was provided an exceptional patient experience." - Tanya McCarter , UI Health employee             “I chose UIC because their personalized treatment plan works for me—comprehensive and affordable. And they helped me understand how important oral health is to my overall health"             "As a UIC employee, going to the College of Dentistry  is so convenient– they are just a 5 minute bike ride away from my campus office. Most of all, I appreciate their professionalism and friendliness– I feel comfortable talking to them, and it makes me proud to be a part of the UIC community!"             “They were so good at getting him to not be afraid – before coming to UIC, he wouldn’t even open his mouth. Now, his teeth are fixed, and he’s even brushing and flossing more! Thanks UIC!”             "I was experiencing discomfort on the right side in the back of my tongue. I thought my tongue was scratching a chipped tooth. A later biopsy showed that I had tongue cancer. My dentist made an appointment with Dr. Markiewicz and told me that Dr. Markiewicz not only was his teacher but his specialty was tongue cancer.  Dr.Markiewicz answered all my questions which really helped me understand. The best part was when he told me that we caught the cancer in it's infancy and that it hadn't spread. Since the surgery , I've been cancer free. Not only do I think that Dr. Markiewicz is awesome I also think he ROCKS!!!"  -- Google Review             “I keep coming back to UIC Dentistry because they keep me well informed and I know I’m getting excellent care”             " As a retired UIC administrator, I’ve used the College of Dentistry for over 30 years now, and the one constant in coming here has always been a genuine sense of caring about me as a person. I know that I’m getting the best of care by experts using the latest technology and treatment."             "She needed an emergency root canal and she was so afraid of going to the dentist. The dentists at UIC helped her to feel comfortable and not so afraid."             “Besides the convenience and price, I especially like the cultural diversity of the students and instructors at UIC. It makes for a very friendly atmosphere.”             “Best service for the money. My student dentist is very professional, friendly and always asking me questions and explaining the treatments. And I’m more knowledgeable about my teeth because of the educational environment.”             “At UIC I get two dentists – the student and the instructor – so I feel confident I’m getting the best treatment, and the price is affordable.”             "It was a long process including root canals, pulled teeth, implants and two sets of temporaries to correct my bite. But the final product was fabulous!!! And the cost was much less than what I would have paid elsewhere." -- Facebook review             "They always do a great job. I don’t trust just any dentist to work on my kids teeth but for some reason these students make me feel comfortable. All of my three children have been here. Keep up the great work guys!" -- Facebook review             “Believe  me when I say , a dental chair is the last place I want to be. I have a huge fear of dentists due to multiple bad experiences. Dr. Zurich in the UIC Prosthodontics specialty clinic replaced a dental bridge for me, and did an excellent job. He has an amazing bedside manner that immediately makes one feel comfortable and at ease. And, the UIC dental staff were very helpful in submitting my insurance claim.”             “I had an emergency issue with my crown and this was my first time going to a student dentist. I’m really impressed with the level of professionalism from the students and the instructors, and how well they explain everything. I will highly recommend UIC to others.”          Previous     Next        Read more patient testimonials          Healthy Smiles   View All                 The Many Costs (Financial and Well-Being) of Poor Oral Health      Financial limitations often prevent people from getting timely dental care.
