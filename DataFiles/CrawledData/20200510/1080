Negative Decisions    Receiving a negative decision is never easy, but you can trust that our decision was reached only after multiple, thorough reviews of your application, essays, recommendations, transcripts, and test scores.  If you received a negative decision, you may consider applying for a later term. Keep in mind that completing the recommended number of credit hours and prerequisite coursework listed in our transfer guide will improve your chances of being admitted as a transfer student. We typically receive more applications than spaces available but the applicant pool varies from term to term. Visit the transfer requirements page for more details.  All undergraduate applicants denied admission to UIC also have the option to appeal their decision. Please note that this appeal must include new and compelling evidence that was not considered during the initial rounds of review. Visit the appeals page for more details and deadlines.
