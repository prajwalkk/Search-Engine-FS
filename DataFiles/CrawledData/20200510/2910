CAVE      CAVE2™ , the next-generation large-scale virtual-reality environment, is a hybrid system that combines the benefits of both scalable-resolution display walls and virtual-reality systems to create a seamless 2D / 3D environment that supports both information-rich analysis as well as virtual-reality simulation exploration at a resolution matching human visual acuity.           SHINGRIX      Shingrix is a fully recombinant vaccine designed to prevent Shingles, a painful condition caused by a resurgent latent Varicella Zoster (chicken pox) virus. As our bodies age, the latent virus may become active and presents as a painful rash. Thirty three percent of Americans will suffer from Shingles at least once in their lifetime.The Office of Technology Management honors Dr. Abbas Vafai’s early role in the initial development of GSK’s new Shingles vaccine conducted here at the University of Illinois and the University of Colorado.           DEEP      DEEP™ is a diabetes self-management program that has been shown to be successful in helping participants take control of their disease and reduce the risk of complications.
