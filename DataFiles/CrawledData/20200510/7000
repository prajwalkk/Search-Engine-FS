    employment described in the I-129 petition filed with USCIS and for the
    period approved on your I-797.  Do not accept additional employment or work at
    an additional location without consulting with OIS in advance.  You can have more than one H-1B sponsor, but
    this requires a separate I-129 filing.  Have the department notify OIS if significant
    changes in duties, responsibilities, salary, or work site are expected
    during your authorized employment.  An amended petition may be
    necessary.      Immigration Documents    Maintain a valid passport at all times, valid
    for at least six months into the future.  Retain copies of all immigration documents
    including: current and expired passports, Forms I-797, I-94, etc.  The I-797 approval notice is your property; there is a fee to request a duplicate I-797
    approval notice, if lost.  If you changed from another immigration status
    or H employer, notify your last institution of your UIC H-1B.  I-94 :   Always review and save your new I-94 after
        reentry.  Form I-94 must indicate "Admitted as:
        H-1B" and “Admitted until date” matching your I-797 H-1B approval
        notice, or an additional 10 days.  Incorrect end date: If your I-94 indicates
        any other expiration date, contact OIS. Passport expiry within
        six month is a common reason for a shortened I-94.  If this occurs,
        your work authorization and status are shortened to this date and we must
        work to re-extend your status as soon as possible.       H-1B Validity Period    Maximum duration is six years, some exceptions
    apply.  Renewals :   Your department will need to initiate the H-1
        B extension process (if eligible) 4-6 months prior to your H-1B expiry
        date.   Recapture :   Time outside of the United States may be
        “recaptured.” Keep copies of all documentation of your time outside
        of the country in the event you need to extend your H-1B beyond six
        years.       H-4 Dependents    Generally, H-4 dependents are not eligible to
    work, or volunteer to work.  They may attend school.  Some H-4s
    may apply for work authorization in certain cases.  Consult OIS if
    you have questions.      Address Changes    Report any change in residential address,
    within 10 days of moving, to USCIS ( Form
    AR-11 ), to OIS by email ois@uic.edu , and via
    UIC’s My
    Profile page. If your H is pending at USCIS,
    print AR-11 or call 1-800-375-5283.      Immigration Site Visits    USCIS’ FDNS (Fraud Detection and National
    Security) unit must conduct random site visits on 20,000 H-1B workers
    every year.  FDNS usually contacts OIS first. If an FDNS
    officer appears at your work place, please ask to see identification and
    contact OIS immediately.  FDNS inspectors are verifying your work
    information and may take photographs of your lab/office space as well as
    ask you questions related to your employment.      Legal Permanent Residence (LPR)/Green Card    H-1B status is “dual intent,” unlike other
    non-immigrant statuses; you may file for LPR while in H-1B status: see our Use of
    Attorneys Policy and UIC
    Sponsorship of Permanent Immigrant Visas and Consular Processing web pages.  If you obtain LPR/a green card, please send a
    copy to OIS as soon as possible to close your OIS record.      Taxes    Individuals in H
    status are required to file both state and federal taxes.        Travel and Visa Process    Schedule an appointment with the U.S. Consulate/Embassy and complete Form DS-160 with fee.  Review consulate/embassy website for guidance about required documents. We suggest bringing:   Passport (valid for six months beyond reentry date)  Original H-1B Approval Notice  Copy of Labor Condition Application (ETA Form 9035) and I-129 petition  Employment offer or recently dated sponsoring department letter  Copies of most recent earnings statements  If a former J-1 Exchange Visitor:  copies of all prior Forms DS-2019, original I-612 Approval Notice or Advisory Opinion letter    H-4s :  In addition to the above, they should bring proof of marriage, or birth, when applying for a visa. If they are traveling independently from you, they should carry your original I-797 approval notice, or their own original H-4 I-797 approval notice, if they have one.  Automatic Visa Revalidation exception : H-1Bs (and H-4s) may travel to Canada and Mexico with an expired visa for less than 30 days. Other exceptions may apply, please see our website for additional travel details.             Grace Periods   You have a 10-day grace period after the end
    date of your I-797 approval notice. You may not work during this
    period; it is time to prepare to leave the U.S., change status, etc.  If your department ends your employment before
    the I-797 end date, as above, you have 60 days to remain in the country
    and have a new sponsor file a petition for you.  (See “portability”
    below.)      Portability    It is possible to “port” or “transfer” your
    H-1B status to another employer/institution; the new employer will file a
    Form I-129 on your behalf.  Employment should be continuous from UIC to
    the next employer. If your department ends your employment early, you may
    have up to 60 days to remain in the country and seek other employment. You
    may not work or volunteer during the transitional time. Your future H-1B
    sponsor will notify you when you may begin your new employment.  Please consult with your new employer for
    details on this process.      Departure    You must submit a Departure
    Verification Form upon completion of employment. This form is
    required regardless of your departure reason:  leaving the U.S.,
    changing employers, or changing immigration status.  If your department ends your employment before
    the I-797 end date, you must be offered a return ticket to your home
    country, which you may accept or decline.      Unlawful Presence    This occurs when you stay beyond the ending
    date of your I-94 or upon determination by Department of Homeland
    Security. Consequences include a 3-year bar from reentering the U.S. if
    you have stayed unlawfully in the U.S. for 180 days or more, and a 10-year
    bar if you remain unlawfully in the U.S. for 360 days or more. Violation
    of your H-1B status makes you ineligible for any immigration benefits.
    This does not apply if a timely, non-frivolous petition to extend your
    stay has been received by the USCIS prior to the end date of your I-94.         xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
