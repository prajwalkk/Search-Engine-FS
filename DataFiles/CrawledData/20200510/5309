The lectern has several items on its surface, within convenient reach.    Tap the control panel touch screen to have it light up. The screen may periodically turn off when not touched for a while; you just need to tap it again.    Tap the Power button in the upper right corner of the control panel. The digital projector will turn on and the system will start up.      To raise/lower the lectern worksurface in this room  Instructions   The entire lectern surface can be raised and lowered with the lift buttons located next to the keyboard tray.    This functionality provides ADA accessibility, as well as the ability to use the lectern while either sitting or standing.       To use the lectern computer in this room  Instructions   Tap the Lectern Computer button on the control panel.    The keyboard and mouse can be found on the pull-out tray.    Tap the spacebar or move/click the mouse to bring the computer out of hibernation.    The log in screen should appear on the computer monitor. Type in your NetID and common password.  If it is the first time you’ve signed into this machine, it will take a few moments to load.    To browse the Internet, click the “Internet Tools” icon on the desktop and use one of the browsers in the folder such as Firefox.    To connect a USB device, such as a flash drive or iClicker Receiver, connect to either the USB port that is on the top of the lectern near the microphone, or to a USB port on the front of the PC itself (located in the equipment rack of the lectern).     When you are done, remember to Log Off from the computer, but do not turn the computer off.      To use a laptop or external device in this room  Instructions   Set your laptop or external device on the worksurface of the lectern.    Connect your device using either the HDMI cable, the VGA cable and the audio plug (if you are using audio), or the RCA ports. These connection cables can be found in the cubby labeled External Inputs. Some devices may need an adapter – this is your responsibility to bring with you, or the ACCC can temporarily lend you an adapter if we have one.    With some devices, you may need to enter a command to show the video image to the projector.  This command varies from device to device.  Windows-based laptops usually respond to “Windows key + P” and toggling through the display options.    Some devices may need to have the resolution adjusted. The best resolution would be 1920 x 1080, but other resolutions such as 1280 x 720 will also work.    Tap the External Inputs button on the control panel, then select which connection type you are using. The system will detect which you have connected and state that a signal is present.    To access the internet, you should connect wirelessly to the UIC-WiFi network, or connect to the ethernet cable available in the cubby.      To use the document camera in this room  Instructions   The document camera will on the lectern surface. Select the Document Camera on the control panel.    Press the power button on the document camera.    Use the tab on the camera arm, while holding the base of the camera down, to raise the camera to its standard position.    Controls are on the head of the document camera. The wheel control lets you zoom in and out on the document.    The Freeze button on the camera will capture a still of whatever is on the stage at that point. Just press the button again to unfreeze.    To finish with the document camera, turn it off and pull the tab straight towards you while holding the base down. This will make the camera bend back into the folded position.      To use the Blu-Ray/DVD player in this room  Instructions   Press the Blu-Ray/DVD button on the control panel.    Press the Power button on the touch screen to turn the player on.    The playback controls for the Blu-Ray/DVD will appear on the control panel. Controls can also be used at the player itself.    Load the Blu-Ray/DVD disc into the player, located in the lectern equipment rack.    When you are finished with the Blu-Ray/DVD, please remove it from the player, then tap the Power button on the control panel to turn the player off.      To show/hide the projected image in this room  Instructions   Tap the Hide Video button on the control panel.    The source will continue to display on the instructor monitor, but will not show through the digital projector.    To begin showing the source through the projector, press the same button once more.      To use the lectern microphone in this room  Instructions   The microphone is located on the top of the lectern. The microphone will always be on.    See "To control the volume in this room" for instructions on adjusting audio levels.    No adjustments should be needed for the lectern microphone for general usage, though. You must stay behind the lectern for the microphone to pick up your voice.      To use the wireless microphone in this room  Instructions   A wireless microphone (Fig 1) is available for this classroom, and is stored either in a charger on the lectern (for classrooms at the perimeter of the east side of campus) or at the LTS Support office to be available for faculty using the classroom.    If the microphone is not stored in the classroom, please stop in at the LTS Support office in Lecture Center E room E112 to check out the microphone for your class. No reservation is needed, just have your iCard with you. You can also designate your Teaching Assistant to pick up the microphone if you choose.    To use the wireless microphone in the room, turn it on with the small toggle switch at the top of the body pack (Fig 2) and it will sync with the lectern. The bodypack can clip to your pants or be placed in a pocket, and the microphone head clips to your collar or fits on your ear.    Unless the microphone is permanently stored in the classroom, you must then return the microphone promptly after your class so that others may check it out for their classes.           Fig. 1       Fig. 2          To control volume in this room  Instructions   The volume for the computer, Blu-Ray/DVD Player, and any external source is controlled on the control panel by pressing the Source button in the Volume Controls section, and pressing the up/down arrows to the left.     The volume for the microphones is controlled in the same way, but pressing the buttons labeled either Lectern Mic or Wireless Mic first.    To mute an audio source, press the Mute icon next to the Source, Lectern Mic, and/or Wireless Mic buttons.      To finish in this room  Instructions   Be sure to turn the system off when you are finished with your class.    If you have used the lectern computer, be sure to log off. If you have used the Blu-Ray/DVD player, be sure to remove the disc. Remove any USB devices you may have connected to the lectern.    Press the Power button in the upper right corner of the control panel and then press Yes to confirm the shut down. The projector will turn off and cool down, and will shortly become ready for the next class to use.
