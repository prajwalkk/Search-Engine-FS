UIC Police, in compliance with the Department of Education, provides our (prospective) students, staff, and community with information detailing the types of crimes and incidents that occur on and around campus. This information is meant to allow everyone to have a more transparent look at what is happening behind the scenes on campus. UIC Police hopes, that in providing this information, everyone can stay informed become more conscious of their safety and surroundings.  The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act of 1990 mandates that colleges and universities report certain criminal incidents to the U.S. Department of Education each calendar year. The crimes covered by the Act are reported in the following eight major categories, with several sub-categories:   Criminal Homicide — categorized as Murder and Non-negligent Manslaughter, and Negligent Manslaughter.  Sex Offenses — categorized as Forcible Sex Offenses and Non-forcible Sex Offenses  Hate Crimes  Robbery  Aggravated Assault  Burglary  Motor Vehicle Theft  Arson   Schools are also required to report the following three types of incidents if they result in either an arrest or disciplinary referral:   Liquor Law Violations  Drug Law Violations  Illegal Weapons Possession   If both an arrest and referral are made, only the arrest is counted.  Note: Reviewers of both the Uniform Crime Reporting program and Campus/Clery statistics may discover discrepancies in specific crime categories between the two entities due to variations in reporting practices. Not all offenses are reported to the police but may be reported to a university advisor, i.e., counselor, faculty or staff. While the victim may request no police disclosure, the incident must be reported to Student Affairs, which creates the final campus statistics for the Department of Education, which provides the Clery statistics.
