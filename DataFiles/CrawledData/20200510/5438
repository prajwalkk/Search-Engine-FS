The continuity plan may be activated for:   Natural disasters (e.g., earthquake, office fire, infectious disease epidemic, unexpected death of an essential employee).  Technological disasters (e.g., data loss, connectivity loss, equipment failure).  Human-caused disasters (e.g., theft, civil unrest, cyber-attack, bomb threat, terrorist attack).
