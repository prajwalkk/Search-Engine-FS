Affected services:   The website: acm.cs.uic.edu.  ACM Email may be delayed.   At this time, acm.cs.uic.edu and related services should be back up. A recent change by ACCC caused routing to be treated differently, causing some traffic to be routed out of incorrect interfaces.  These issues has since been resolved.  If you have any questions, please let an ACM/LUG SysAdmin know by emailing sig-sysadmin [at] acm.cs.uic.edu or by messaging the #sig-sysadmin channel on Slack.
