employment at UIC as long as the student is here, and is registered for
classes(Note: off-campus employment is restricted, see below). UIC
employment cannot exceed 20 hours per week when school is in session; this amount includes all other authorized employment . International students may work more than 20 hours per week during official university breaks only (Winter Break, Summer).  On-campus employment does not need to be related to the student’s field of study.  Note: Graduate Assistantships correspond to a percentage of hours to be worked each week:   50% = 20 hours per week  33% = 14-15 hours per week  25% = 10 hours per week   Off-Campus Employment  F-1 students are eligible for off-campus employment authorization in
the form of Curricular Practical Training or Optional Practical
Training. Authorization can be given if the student has been maintaining
their status and if they meet other eligibility requirements (explained
below).  Curricular Practical Training (CPT)  CPT is authorization for off-campus training in the form of an internship, co-op, or
practicum that is an integral part of an established curriculum. CPT
must be either required or course credit must be given toward the
student’s degree program. CPT may be authorized as the student continues to work towards their degree. To apply for CPT, the completed application must be submitted to an OIS advisor during open advising hours. The
student must have the approved CPT I-20 before they begin training.  Optional Practical Training (OPT)  F-1 students are eligible for up to twelve months of Optional
Practical Training (OPT) authorization for each level of study (example
BS, MS, PhD). The majority of students apply for OPT as they near the
end of their academic studies. Utilizing OPT after completion of studies
allows students the opportunity to use the skills they have learned at
UIC in a “real world” environment.  Pre-completion Optional Practical Training may be done during
specific times before the student graduates, or after they graduate. F-1
students are eligible for up to twelve months of OPT authorization for
each level of study (example BS, MS, PhD). Students must attend a
mandatory OIS OPT Workshop to obtain the application (see below) prior
to applying for OPT.  Mandatory Workshop for Those Applying for OPT  The Office of International Services conducts mandatory workshops for
F-1 international students interested in applying for Optional
Practical Training (OPT) throughout the semester. Students applying for
OPT must first attend one of these workshops. There, students will learn
about the OPT application process, maintaining immigration status and
other important procedures. Dates and times for these workshops are
listed on the OIS calendar .  24-Month Extension of OPT (STEM)  F-1 students approved for standard post-completion OPT  based on a
bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree in a science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) field may be eligible to apply for a 24-month extension of post-completion OPT for a total authorization of 36 months. More information about the STEM OPT extension, including the Department of Homeland Security list of eligible CIP codes, can be found online at Study in the State STEM OPT Hub .  For information about eligibility and application procedures for UIC alumni, please email the STEM OPT Team at stemopt@uic.edu . We recommend that you begin the STEM extension application process around four months prior to the expiration of your current 12-month post-completion OPT EAD. USCIS will not accept STEM OPT extension applications after the expiration date on your current EAD.   xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
