Siow’s focus is on education research — innovative methods of content delivery and assessment. He presented at the American Society for Engineering Education last year on the use of visualization methods he implemented in a thermodynamics course to help students grasp a complex three-dimensional shape.  “There’s a famous 3-D pressure-volume-temperature diagram that’s complex, but students really need to understand from the beginning,” Siow said. “They can’t learn it from textbooks, which are two-dimensional, so I turned it into a two-part active learning project.”  In the first part, he directs students to play with their food — to “sculpt the shape, and understand the intricacies of the slope and curves” of the PVT diagram. Then, students model the shape using CAD software and use another software to render the 3-D shape as sliced planes.  Finally, they present their work in the form of a report.  “Instead of homework, I assign projects,” he said. “Students need to relate and apply what they learn in class.”      Modified on June 06, 2019                  UIC Logo         College of  Engineering            Contact   College of Engineering  851 S.
