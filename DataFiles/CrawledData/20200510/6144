As of September 2018, all but two health academic programs at UIC are required to meet  accreditation standards that relate to teamwork and ICP or call for students to participate in interprofessional education (IPE); in September 2015, only half  of the specialized accrediting bodies for  health sciences academic programs at UIC were required to meet specific standards.  A ccreditation standards for health sciences colleges underscore the significance of IPE/ICP into their respective curricula. Excerpts of specific IPE/ICP standards for each of the seven health sciences colleges at UIC are summarized below and highlights terms beyond IPE to include references to interprofessional communications and collaboration. The criteria identified below are directly retrieved from the accreditation standards as of August 2019.  In February 2019, the  Health Professions Accreditors Collaborative (HPAC) released a report to provide additional guidance to institutions on implementing quality IPE. Specifically, HPAC adopted shared terminology, definitions, and competencies for IPE and ICP across the 25-member accreditors of HPAC.

Dentistry     Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD)         Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD)   Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA), Accreditation Standards for Dental Education Programs  Collaboration with other Health Care Professionals Access to health care and changing demographics are driving a new vision of the health care workforce. Dental curricula can change to develop a new type of dentist, providing opportunities early in their educational experiences to engage allied colleagues and other health care professionals. Enhancing the public’s access to oral health care and the connection of oral health to general health form a nexus that links oral health care providers to colleagues in other health professions. Health care professionals educated to deliver patient-centered care as members of an interdisciplinary team present a challenge for educational programs. Patient care by all team members will emphasize evidence-based practice, quality improvement approaches, the application of technology and emerging information, and outcomes assessment. Dental education programs are to seek and take advantage of opportunities to educate dental school graduates who will assume new roles in safeguarding, promoting, and caring for the health care needs of the public.  Standard 2-20 : Graduates must be competent in communicating and collaborating with other members of the health care team to facilitate the provision of health care.  Intent: In attaining competence, students should understand the roles of members of the health care team and have educational experiences, particularly clinical experiences, that involve working with other healthcare professional students and practitioners. Students should have educational experiences in which they coordinate patient care within the health care system relevant to dentistry.

The Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice  Essential VI: Interprofessional Communication and Collaboration for Improving  Patient Health Outcomes (2008)  Rationale Effective communication and collaboration among health professionals is imperative to  providing patient-centered care. All health professions are challenged to educate future  clinicians to deliver patient­centered care as members of an interprofessional team, emphasizing communication, evidence-based practice, quality improvement approaches, and informatics (IOM, 2003a). Interprofessional education is defined as interactive  educational activities involving two or more professions that foster collaboration to  improve patient care (Freeth, Hammick, Koppel, & Reeves, 2002). Teamwork among  healthcare professionals is associated with delivering high quality and safe patient care  (Barnsteiner, Disch, Hall, Mayer, & Moore, 2007). Collaboration is based on the  complementarities of roles and the understanding of these roles by the members of the  healthcare teams.  Interprofessional education enables the baccalaureate graduate to enter the workplace  with baseline competencies and confidence for interactions and with communication  skills that will improve practice, thus yielding better patient outcomes. Interprofessional  education can occur in a variety of settings. An essential component for the  establishment of collegial relationships is recognition of the unique discipline­-specific  practice spheres. Fundamental to effective interprofessional and intra­professional  collaboration is a definition of shared goals; clear role expectations of members; a  flexible decision-making process; and the establishment of open communication patterns and leadership. Thus, interprofessional education optimizes opportunities for the  development of respect and trust for other members of the healthcare team.  The baccalaureate program prepares the graduate to:   Compare/contrast the roles and perspectives of the nursing profession with other  care professionals on the healthcare team (i.e., scope of discipline, education and  licensure requirements).  Use inter­ and intraprofessional communication and collaborative skills to deliver  evidence-­based, patient­centered care.  Incorporate effective communication techniques, including negotiation and  conflict resolution to produce positive professional working relationships.  Contribute the unique nursing perspective to  interprofessional teams to optimize patient outcomes.  Demonstrate appropriate teambuilding  and  collaborative strategies when working  with interprofessional teams.  Advocate for high quality and safe patient care as a member of the  interprofessional team.

The Essential of Master’s Education in Nursing (2011)  Essential VII: Interprofessional Collaboration for Improving Patient and Population Health Outcomes  Rationale In a redesigned health system a greater emphasis will be placed on cooperation, communication, and collaboration among all health professionals in order to integrate care in teams and ensure that care is continuous and reliable. Therefore, an expert panel at the Institute of Medicine (IOM) identified working in interdisciplinary teams as one of the five core competencies for all health professionals (IOM, 2003).  Interprofessional collaboration is critical for achieving clinical prevention and health promotion goals in order to improve patient and population health outcomes (APTR, 2008; 2009). Interprofessional practice is critical for improving patient care outcomes and, therefore, a key component of health professional education and lifelong learning (American Association of Colleges of Nursing & the Association of American Medical Colleges, 2010). The IOM also recognized the need for care providers to demonstrate a greater awareness to “patient values, preferences, and cultural values,” consistent with the Healthy People 2010 goal of achieving health equity through interprofessional approaches (USHHS, 2000). In this context, knowledge of broad determinants of health will enable the master’s graduate to succeed as a patient advocate, cultural and systems broker, and to lead and coordinate interprofessional teams across care environments in order to reduce barriers, facilitate access to care, and improve health outcomes. Successfully leading these teams is achieved through skill development and demonstrating effective communication, planning, and implementation of care directly with other healthcare professionals (AACN, 2007).  Improving patient and population health outcomes is contingent on both horizontal and vertical health delivery systems that integrate research and clinical expertise to provide patient-centered care. Inherently the systems must include patients’ expressed values, needs, and preferences for shared decision making and management of their care. As  members and leaders of interprofessional teams, the master’s-prepared nurse will actively communicate, collaborate, and consult with other health professionals to manage and coordinate care across systems.  The master’s-degree program prepares the graduate to:   Advocate for the value and role of the professional nurse as member and leader of interprofessional healthcare teams.  Understand other health professions’ scopes of practice to maximize contributions within the healthcare team.  Employ collaborative strategies in the design, coordination, and evaluation of patient-centered care.  Use effective communication strategies to develop, participate, and lead interprofessional teams and partnerships.  Mentor and coach new and experienced nurses and other members of the healthcare team.  Functions as an effective group leader or member based on an in-depth understanding of team dynamics and group processes.     Sample Content   Scopes of practice for nursing and other professions  Differing world views among healthcare team members  Concepts of communication, collaboration, and coordination  Conflict management strategies and principles of negotiation  Organizational processes to enhance communication  Types of teams and team roles  Stages of team development  Diversity of teams  Cultural diversity  Patient-centered care  Change theories  Multiple-intelligence theory  Group dynamics  Power structures  Health-work environments         Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP)         Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP)   The Essentials of Doctoral Education for Advanced Nursing Practice, October 2006 .  Essential VI: Interprofessional Collaboration for Improving Patient and Population Health Outcomes Today’s complex, multi-tiered health care environment depends on the contributions of highly skilled and knowledgeable individuals from multiple professions. In order to accomplish the IOM mandate for safe, timely, effective, efficient, equitable, and patient-centered care in a complex environment, healthcare professionals must function as highly collaborative teams (AACN, 2004; IOM, 2003; O’Neil, 1998). DNP members of these teams have advanced preparation in the interprofessional dimension of health care that enable them to facilitate collaborative team functioning and overcome impediments to interprofessional practice. Because effective interprofessional teams function in a highly collaborative fashion and are fluid depending upon the patients’ needs, leadership of high performance teams changes. Therefore, DNP graduates have preparation in methods of effective team leadership and are prepared to play a central role in establishing interprofessional teams, participating in the work of the team, and assuming leadership of the team when appropriate.  The DNP program prepares the graduate to:   Employ effective communication and collaborative skills in the development and implementation of practice models, peer review, practice guidelines, health policy, standards of care, and/or other scholarly products.  Lead interprofessional teams in the analysis of complex practice and organizational issues.  Employ consultative and leadership skills with intraprofessional and interprofessional teams to create change in health care and complex healthcare delivery systems.
