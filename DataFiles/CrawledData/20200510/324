As a human-computer interaction researcher interested in facilitating collaborative learning, exhibits provide a unique high-stakes "crucible" for testing the ability of an interaction design to engage learners with the exhibit content and with one another. If you don't get it right, visitors just walk away.  My designs, often developed in collaboration with domain experts, employ emerging interactive technologies selected for their unique affordances to make challenging concepts or phenomena more accessible to novice learners. I use these designs to explore both Human-Computer Interaction and Learning Sciences research questions. I have also worked with mobile devices, both in informal learning contexts (where the mobile devices act as Opportunistic User Interfaces to computer-based exhibits) and in formal contexts.  Projects:  Below is a list of the more established projects I am currently involved in, but I have a number of other projects cooking as well, involving user interface designs resting on technologies as far afield as Augmented Reality, flea power sensors, and mobile GPS. I'll post those here once they simmer down into a thicker broth. They are all in the service of learning, of course, and more often than not, in the service of informal learning.  As you can see by my list of collaborators below (who specialize in, variously, Urban Planning, Biology, Environmental Science, History, Geography, and Zoology), I am fairly content-agnostic - nothing inspires me more than getting introduced to a new fascinating field of human endeavor (perhaps because I can better place myself in the shoes of the learner who will one day be using the software experience we create?). Time allowing, I'm always interested in potential collaborations, so do get in touch if you have an idea you'd like to bat around with me.  Project Title  Project Description  Collaborator(s)  Funding Source(s)  EcoCollage  The College Board's 2009 redesign of the Science College Board Standards for College Success has initiated a redesign of Advanced Placement tests. The new Environmental Science standards include a much stronger emphasis on "systems thinking" than has been seen in the past. We suspect that Agent-Based Models (ABMs), which are used more frequently in Environmental Science than in any other field, could help students better understand the complex interactions of human-natural systems. A limitation of educational ABMs, however, has always been sufficient access to computers - with our project, we are investigating the viability of a paper-based Tangible User Interface ("Paper-to-Parameters") that, in addition to requiring only a computer, webcam, and projector to support whole-class learning activities, may also provide unique benefits for understanding the spatial and scalar relationships between simulation elements.  The project will develop an assessment tool to obtain a picture of prior understandings and attitudes held by learners in different populations (high school, undergraduate, and graduate students and experts); it will conduct an exploratory trial of the Agent-Based learning intervention to investigate the impacts on learners; andit will investigate how selected user interface features facilitate specific spatial and scalar understandings.

As cultural and historical research is informed by increasingly complex information, museums can and should support visitor discourse around such complex data. To this end, we will construct a prototype museum exhibit, CoCensus , at the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum, using an innovative combination of an ambient data map display, motion sensing technology, and RFID technology to allow visitors to interact with dynamic visualizations of census data on a local map. E pluribus unum has been a central theme in American history since the founding of the nation, yet themes of identity and difference have dominated societal conflicts for just as long. CoCensus offers a space in which people can reflect together on identity categories such as race and ancestry as imperfect mirrors of the nation, and affords shared exploration of the U.S. Census as a core record of our shared social history.  This innovative design will enable multiple visitors to cooperatively investigate and discuss complex data and the personal dimensions of American identity. This work highlights important issues for designing public educational spaces to support collaborative data visualization, and take steps towards making large digital resources accessible within the social learning milieu of museums.

In this project, we are exploring the potential for facilitated workshops with Agent-Based Models to aid stakeholders in the planning process.
