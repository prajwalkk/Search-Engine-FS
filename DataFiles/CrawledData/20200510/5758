UIC Human Resources works in conjunction with academic and administrative units and affiliated University organizations to honor these achievements at the annual Employee Recognition Award Ceremony held each fall.  In addition to service and merit recipients honored at the Employee Recognition Award Ceremony, numerous awards for faculty, research, and individual department achievements are awarded throughout the year by various University units and organizations.  Employee Recognition Month  Each November is Employee Recognition Month at UIC. This special time of year includes departmental ceremonies as well as campus wide programs, planned for the purpose of honoring faculty and staff. In addition to campus wide and individual department merit awards earned for outstanding achievements, UIC honors its employees for years of service beginning at five years and continuing after each five year increment. In 2018, UIC honored over 2,000 employees for years of service.  Employee Recognition Award Ceremony  The Employee Recognition Award Ceremony, held each year at the Isadore and Sadie Dorin Forum at UIC (formerly known as the UIC Forum), is the official start of Employee Recognition Month. This campus wide program serves to publicly recognize work and community accomplishments which in turn help to build morale and motivate our employees. Employees with 25 or more years of service are honored, along with campus wide merit awards. At the conclusion of the ceremony, a reception will take place for all to visit and congratulate the recipients being honored. All members of the UIC community are welcome to attend.  2019 Event Information  The 2019 Employee Recognition Award Ceremony and Reception will be held on Tuesday, November 19, 2019 at the UIC Isadore and Sadie Dorin Forum.

It recognizes the demonstrated excellence of Academic Professional staff. It encourages their professional development and indicates the institution’s high regard for the contributions of this key segment of the university community. The CAPE award is based on peer review broadly selected from the ranks of the Academic Professionals throughout campus. The CAPE Selection Committee is a standing committee of APAC and is chaired by an APAC member. The Selection Committee is made up of Academic Professionals from both the east and west campuses which may include past CAPE recipients. UIC faculty, Academic Professionals, Civil Service employees, and students can nominate a deserving Academic Professional for the award. In 2017 there were six recipients of the CAPE Award. Honorees receive memento gift, a $1,000 permanent increase to the individual’s salary, and a $2,000 one-time cash award.   CAPE Award Website             Janice Watkins Award  The Janice Watkins Award recognizes exceptional Civil Service employees for their distinguished service to the University. Sponsored by the Staff Advisory Council, the design for the award is based on three interlocking components signifying the unity of faculty, staff, and students of the University of Illinois at Chicago. The award is a token of gratitude from the university and is awarded to Civil Service employees who exhibit a pleasant, warm demeanor and provide willing assistance to others and perform duties with diligence and dedication. The nominations can be submitted by faculty, staff, or students familiar with the nominee’s activities.   Janice Watkins Award Website             UI Health  Class Act Award, Employee of the Year, Physician of the Year, Resident of the Year    Hospital guests and staff may nominate UI Health employees for the Class Act Award and the Physician of the Year and Resident of the Year .
