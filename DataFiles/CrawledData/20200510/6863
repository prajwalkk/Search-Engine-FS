On Monday, November 25th a group of 24 students from the Bank of Beijing program completed their short term training program at UIC. They had not worn a cap and gown since they finished their Master's degrees in China, though after six weeks of workshops, classes, and professional visits at UIC and throughout Chicago and Illinois, these students were happy to complete their training program.       text   The Programs for International Partnerships office has enjoyed a 15 year partnership with the Bank of Beijing and Global Bridge to bring in groups of professionals for a short term training program. This group had arrived on campus in early October and took every opportunity to embrace the city in many ways from shopping, watching Chicago sports teams compete, seeing theater productions, visiting museums, and attending events on campus and around the city. As a send off for their hard work during their program, PIP held a graduation ceremony and a lunch at Fogo de Chao, the Brazilian steakhouse downtown.  Chris Biehl, Associate Director of PIP, spoke to the group and commended them on their active engagement with the program and the city. He also praised the relationships and camaraderie that the group foster with one another during their time together in Chicago.  The group leader, David thanked the UIC community, PIP, all of the faculty and administrators involved, and his fellow group members for a great experience. He encouraged his group members to continue to learn and study for their remaining time in the US.  Nora VanderHaas from Global Bridge echoed David’s sentiment and encouraged the students to continue to grow as life long learners and to use not only the lessons from the classroom but also to carry with them the lessons from their travels and intercultural exchange.
