Enhancing Perinatal Mental Health at UI Health         Enhancing Perinatal Mental Health at UI Health   This project focuses on the mental health needs of women who receive perinatal care at UI Health, a population which includes a disproportionate number of people who are low income and members of minority groups. Although rates of perinatal depression are significantly higher among economically disadvantaged women, they seek mental health services at a lower rate than women in general. The goal of this project is to validate the Computerized Adaptive Testing Tools for Mental Health (CAT-MH) a tool for screening for and diagnosis of major depression and anxiety in perinatal women.  We are looking for student volunteers to work with referred patients to administer CAT-MH and conduct the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). Interested students can be at the undergraduate or graduate level from any health professions academic program at UIC. Students will work within the Women’s Mental Health Research Program in the Department of Psychiatry.  This project is right for you if you are interested in:   Health disparities.  Conducting research within an urban, diverse, clinical population.  Combining research and clinical efforts to address gaps in mental health screening, referral and treatment for program participants.   Requirements:   CITI training in Human Subjects Protection and Information Privacy and Security (IPS)/HIPPA.  SCID training to validate depression and anxiety in patients through online videos and practice interviews.  Conduct research visits with patients, either in person or over the phone.  This project requires a minimum of a one semester time commitment with a maximum of 4 hours per week. Involvement for more than one semester is preferred.  The first group of students will begin in January, 2019.   What will you gain?   Experience in administering assessments and conducting interviews with socioeconomically diverse populations.  Participation in monthly multidisciplinary Perinatal Mental Health meetings held with clinicians & researchers from the department of Psychiatry, Obstetrics & Gynecology, including nurses, midwives, social workers and the research team.   If you would like to be considered for this project, please fill out an interest form by November 30, 2018 and a member of the Women’s Mental Health Research Program will contact you with additional information in December 2018.
