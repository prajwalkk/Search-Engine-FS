Since the mid-1980s, we’ve operated the Home Care Program on behalf of the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) .This program supports families who care for loved ones who are medically fragile and require skilled in-home nursing care. Many of our participants also depend on technology for their well-being.  The Home Care Program helps youth remain in their family home through care coordination provided by nurses and social workers employed by DSCC. Our care coordinators do many things to help support families, such as helping find resources, connecting to service providers, paying for home modifications, accompanying parents to medical appointments, attending Individualized Education Program meetings, assisting with the transition to adult services, etc.  Below you’ll find additional information about Home Care and helpful links for providers who provide in-home nursing and durable medical equipment services.      Guidance on Home Medical Supplies During COVID-19 Outbreak Adequate quantities of home medical supplies are essential to safely care for technology-dependent children at home during the COVID-19 crisis. Families should consider cleaning and re-using supplies when safely possible in case there’s a future shortage of critical items.  Home Care Referral Card We need your help to identify eligible children and obtain support documentation.  Maintaining Care Handout for Home Care Participants  Families, healthcare providers, funding resources and others all have important responsibilities and expectations to fulfill once the child is transitioned home.
