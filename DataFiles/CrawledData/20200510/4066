Give now to the Medical Evaluation Response Initiative Team (MERIT) Fund through the College of Medicine Rockford giving page.  Buy From the Amazon Wish List The MERIT Amazon Wish List is a great way to directly help the children that we serve. Through the Amazon.com wish list, individuals can select and purchase items that will be delivered to MERIT and distributed directly to the children and families that need our support most.
