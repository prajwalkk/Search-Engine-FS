Graduate funding overview    Online funding resources    Office of Student Financial Aid       Research fellowships and scholarships   Some of our students have teaching assistantships that utilize their talents in various colleges or administrative areas on campus. Many of these include tuition waivers in addition to a stipend; however, we do  not recommend that students in their first semester hold assistantships.  There are also a few Board of Trustees, merit-based tuition waivers available each term, and all students may apply for these. If you’re selected for admission to our program, please request the application form for a first semester tuition waiver.  Other scholarships and fellowships include:   Van Doren Scholarship: AHS students in good standing who demonstrate financial need are eligible for the Van Doren Scholarship. First preference is given to minority applicants. All applicants must have on file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form for need verification.  Tom Jones Scholarship and Alice and Brian Katz Scholarship: These two BVIS awards are traditionally given to second year students during spring semester. Students don’t apply for these—they’re based on academic achievement and potential for success and are voted on by the BVIS faculty.  Lillian B. Torrence Award: This award is given to a second year BVIS student based on academic achievement and an expressed interest in rehabilitative activities or studies. If your research project involves rehabilitation and makes a significant contribution to patient care, you stand a good chance of receiving this award.  The Vesalius Trust : The Vesalius Trust for Visual Communication in the Health Sciences strives to develop and support education and research programs in the field of health science communications. BVIS students apply in the fall of their second year for competitive research scholarships and are judged on background, education, project concept, design and production plan.
