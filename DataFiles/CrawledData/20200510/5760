Payroll & Earnings    The Payroll Services Office facilitates the accurate and timely payment of employees on three campuses: Urbana, Chicago and Springfield. Payroll Services offices also manage payroll schedules, earnings, deductions, taxes, and time reporting.  All employees at the University of Illinois are paid either on a bi-weekly or monthly basis. Bi-weekly employees are paid every other Wednesday approximately 10 days after the pay period end date. Monthly employees are paid on the 16th of the month following the service dates of the 16th through the 15th. If the 16th of the month falls on a weekend or holiday then the pay date is the last work day prior.  Please note the due date for paperwork to be submitted to UIC Human Resources for each pay period. It is extremely important these due dates are adhered to if an employee is to be paid their full paycheck on their scheduled payday.
