Taylor St.  The summer camp is an opportunity for Chicago-area high school and middle school students to explore what they can achieve in life through engineering. The camp is designed to introduce students to the research laboratory environment and provide a variety of hands-on learning experiences where they can design projects that are intended to improve the environment and quality of life. The activities include 3D printing and rapid prototyping, coding, robotics, renewable energy, product design, aerodynamics, structures and safety, and efficiency and productivity.  Additionally, students will learn about career opportunities and be inspired to pursue engineering as a lifelong commitment.  “The summer camp is a chance for students to experience life as a student on a Chicago college campus, while discovering the creative aspects of engineering,” said Yeow Siow, a Clinical Assistant Professor in MIE. “We are looking for kids who are inquisitive and curious about the world around them, and want to try new things, meet new people, and use their heads and hands to solve problems.”  The non-residential camp runs from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., Monday to Friday, and it is broken down into three sessions. Track 1 is a two-week program running from July 10 to July 21 for ages 16 and up. Cost of attendance is $600 per student. Tracks 2 and 3 are one-week programs. Track 2 starts July 24 for ages 13, 14 and 15; and Track 3 begins July 31 for middle school students ages 10 to 12. Cost of attendance is $300 per student. The camp includes lunches, materials and prizes.  The department is offering an “After Camp” service, from 3 to 6 p.m. for Tracks 2 and 3. Chaperones stay with the kids on campus until parents come pick their child up. The cost for After Camp is $20 per day or $100 for the week in addition to the camp fee. A limited number of need-based fee waivers are available. In addition, UIC employees will receive 10% discount. The deadline to register is June 30 or until we reach capacity.
