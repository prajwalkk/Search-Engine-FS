Since 2013, the program has provided over 6,000 students with an introduction to the importance of interprofessional collaborative practice and provided the opportunity to explore the roles and responsibilities of various health professions and interprofessional communication. Students from dentistry, health informatics, health information management, health care administration, medicine, nursing, nutrition, occupational therapy, pharmacy, physical therapy, public health and social work currently participate in the program across the three sites.  At each of the 3 different campus locations, the program has been tailored to meet the needs of the learners.  In Chicago, learners from 13 different professions and facilitators from all 7 health science colleges, the University Library, UI Hospital, Office of Student Affairs and the Office of Diversity participate in teams that include a full range of clinical and non-clinical professions. In Rockford, BSN students from outside UIC participate to add to the interprofessional experience of the UIC learners and experience working with standardized patients.  In Peoria, the learners have the advantage of the facilities of the state of the art Jump Simulation Center.
