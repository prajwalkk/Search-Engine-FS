Through readings and discussion, students will examine various cultivation strategies and address the task that both professional and volunteer fundraisers find most difficult – the Ask. At the end of five weeks, you will understand that the Ask is not a standalone endeavor, but part of a much larger process. Once that process is in place organization’s individual gift level can potentially increase.
