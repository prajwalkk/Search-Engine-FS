Bachelor of Science in Mathematics         Bachelor of Science in Mathematics   Mathematics is the abstract study of number, pattern, quantity, systems, and space, as well as the language of science and all fields in which patterns and systematic processes are analyzed. Taking courses in the mathematical sciences helps students learn to conceptualize abstract structures and provides them with the framework and analytical tools necessary for understanding our technology-based and data-intensive society. The MATH major prepares students for graduate study in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics, and mathematical computer science. Both the MATH major and minor sequences help prepare students for a wide range of opportunities in the natural sciences, social sciences, business, finance, and government; for professional schools, such as law school; and for almost any job or career in which strong analytical and communication skills are valued.

General advising information    Undergraduate catalog entry          Bachelor of Science in Mathematical Computer Science         Bachelor of Science in Mathematical Computer Science    The MCS curiculum fosters the development of logical and analytical thinking and is designed to provide a basic foundation for a career in the forefront of computing. Emphasis is given to the mathematical theory of computer science and computational methods. The program concentrates on both the practical and theoretical aspects of computer science such as numerical computing, super computing, programming languages, algorithms, complexity, coding theory, combinatorics and graph theory. The curriculum is intended for students who seek careers in systems and/or mathematical computing.

General advising information    Undergraduate catalog entry    MCS website          Bachelor of Science in Statistics         Bachelor of Science in Statistics    With today’s technology, it is easy to collect and store a tremendous amount of data. To make sense out of all this information requires data processing and analysis skills, along with a general “data literacy”. For students to be prepared for work in a data-rich field, it is essential that they be properly trained in statistics. The Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science offers a Bachelor of Science degree in Statistics with two possible tracks, or concentrations. The Statistical Theory and Methods concentration provides a classical training in statistics, ideally suited for students planning to attend graduate school in statistics or other data-focused disciplines. The Applied Statistics concentration is more interdisciplinary, allowing students to select an application area of focus, such as biology and economics, to complement their basic statistical training. This concentration is well-suited for students planning for a career in government or industry.
