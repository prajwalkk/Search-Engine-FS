When I look back on my two years at Jane Addams, the first thing that comes to my mind is not the diploma. I think about, rather, the thought provoking discussions in the classroom, the passion regarding topics that may not always be the simplest ones to talk about, the unity to stand up against injustice wherever it exists, no matter how small or large it may seem.    Diala Abughosh | MSW '19       Student Quote    I initially chose Jane Addams College because I had discovered who Jane Addams was, and she instantly became a hero to me. However, as I completed my MSW, I learned so much more about the college and its values. The professors are real social workers who inspire me. They recognized my unique traits and interests, and helped me harness my own passion and guide it into something productive and beneficial to the field. The Jane Addams College of Social Work helps populations who are in need, and that is something that I will always stand behind.    Tobi Ballantine | MSW ’17       Student Quote    In Jane Addams’ doctoral program, I have been fortunate to work with well-respected researchers, teach a master’s level course, and gain service experience as a student representative on the doctoral committee. Now that I am focusing almost exclusively on my dissertation and publishing, I am especially grateful to have the continued support and guidance of my dissertation committee, faculty-at-large, and my fellow doctoral students.    Andrew I. Repp | Doctoral Student       Student Quote    Jane Addams truly changed my social work career. I feel so connected to urban city populations after interning on an inpatient psychiatric unit at University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System. If you are a person who wants to develop skills among communities with a variety of issues, and study under those who are truly committed to social work, Jane Addams can open doors for you.
