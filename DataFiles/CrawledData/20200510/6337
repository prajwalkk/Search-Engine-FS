Although we are one of the largest medical schools in the country, we insist on meeting individually with all eligible candidates before extending an offer. We feel this is the perfect time for us to find out if there really is a fit between your needs as a student and our program and culture at University of Illinois. Students will have an opportunity to select the specific campus and date for their interview from the locations and dates available. Students should note that after they have received an offer, campus assignments are made independent of where their interview took place.
