This change allows us to protect the health and safety of our personnel by operating at reduced staffing levels. Additionally, scheduling self-use of instruments through iLab has been suspended . Exemptions may be requested for the following:   Any COVID-19 related projects  Any project that is patient-related or human subjects-related  Projects already in progress now requesting essential project status     PLEASE NOTE: ALL REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTIONS MUST BE SENT VIA EMAIL TO DR. GRODEN AT JGRODEN@UIC.EDU , COPIED TO THE SPECIFIC CORE FACILITY DIRECTOR, AND ALSO COPIED TO RESEARCH@UIC.EDU.
