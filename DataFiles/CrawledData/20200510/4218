All intermediate and advanced courses help students achieve two interlocking goals. First, all courses foster proficiency in speaking, reading, and writing French, as well as understanding how the language is woven into diverse cultural contexts in Francophone countries throughout the world. Second, all courses help students develop a historical sense of French-speaking cultures, as well as the critical and interpretive skills that come from analytical reading, active discussion, and persuasive writing.  A major or a minor in French and Francophone Studies gives students a strong, globally oriented foundation for careers in many fields, such as education, international commerce, law, government, and journalism.  Endorsement for the Teaching of French  Endorsement is available to students obtaining full licensure in an approved UIC Teacher Education major. To teach French as a second subject in Illinois public schools one must apply for and receive an Endorsement from the State Board of Education and meet all of the additional course and other requirements the Board has established. The teaching license is not automatically awarded upon successful completion of licensure and degree requirements. Before the license is issued, the candidate must file an application with the State of Illinois and take a subject content examination administered by the State Board of Education. For information on requirements and application procedures, contact the Council on Teacher Education.  Study Abroad Program  A significant portion of the credits for the major or minor in French may be earned through study abroad. Students who wish to be considered for study abroad should consult the director of undergraduate studies concerning prerequisites and requirements.
