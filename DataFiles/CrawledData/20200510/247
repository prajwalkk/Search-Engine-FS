He received his Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence (AI) from the University of Edinburgh. Before joining UIC, he was a faculty member at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS). His research interests include sentiment analysis, lifelong learning, chatbot, natural language processing (NLP), data mining, machine learning, and AI. He has published extensively in top conferences and journals (his Google Scholar page ). Three of his papers have received Test-of-Time awards: two from SIGKDD (ACM Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining), and one from WSDM (ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining). He is also a recipient of ACM SIGKDD Innovation Award (the most prestigious technical award from SIGKDD). He has also authored four books: two on sentiment analysis, one on lifelong learning, and one on Web mining. Some of his work has been widely reported in the international press, including a front-page article in the New York Times. On professional services, he has served as the Chair of ACM SIGKDD from 2013-2017, as program chair of many leading data mining conferences, including KDD, ICDM, CIKM, WSDM, SDM, and PAKDD, as associate editor of leading journals such as TKDE, TWEB, DMKD and TKDD, and as area chair or senior PC member of numerous NLP, AI, Web, and data mining conferences. He is a Fellow of the ACM, AAAI, and IEEE.

Research Contributions: He is best known for his pioneering work on sentiment analysis and opinion mining (KDD-2004 paper: KDD-2015 test-of-time paper award), fake/deceptive opinion detection, and association rules based classification (KDD-1998 paper: KDD-2014 test-of-time paper award). He is also a pioneer researcher of PU learning (or learning from positive and unlabeled examples) (or set expansion), Web data extraction and interestingness in data mining. In 2013, he started to work on lifelong machine learning and wrote the first ever book dedicated to the topic with his student, published in Nov 2016.    Press Coverage: His work has also made important sociatal impact. He and his work have been reported widely in popular press and tech news media internationally, including a front-page article in the New York Times.
