The College received full accreditation and will have a limited survey visit in February, 2020. The Chicago, Peoria, and Rockford campuses are each independently accredited as Sponsoring Institutions for graduate medical education by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.   The Chicago and Peoria campuses offer a full range of residency and fellowship programs in all major specialties.  The Rockford campus focuses on residency training in primary care, with three family medicine programs (two of them rural) and a hospice/palliative care fellowship. The College of Medicine is also fully accredited by the Accreditation Council on Continuing Medical Education; the next renewal date will be in March 2022.  This accreditation applies to all campuses of the College, and ensures that all relevant intramural and extramurally-directed conferences and other educational activities sponsored by the College for practicing physicians are peer-reviewed and of the highest quality.
