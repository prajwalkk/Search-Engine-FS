Jul  01  2019   by UIC Alert     Public Safety Advisory: July 1, 2019   Posted in Public Safety   On Monday, July 1, at approximately 2:30 p.m. UIC Police responded to a report of a robbery near Harrison St. and Morgan St. The victim, who is not affiliated with UIC, reported that he was approached by two offenders who took his property by force. Both offenders are described as white males, wearing white shirts and blue jeans. The offenders fled eastbound on Harrison St. The Chicago Police Department will lead the investigation. Anyone with information should call 311.  Approximate crime location mapped  UIC Police offer the following security tips:   Be aware of your surroundings. Use all your senses to be alert for danger, and when walking alone, don’t wear headphones or earbuds.  Don’t display valuables in public.  On campus, look for the location of the nearest emergency call box (there are more than 1,500 across campus.)  To contact the UIC Police, call (312) 355-5555 for emergencies or (312) 996-2830 for non-emergencies.  Report crime promptly to police.   Public safety advisories are distributed to the university community in compliance with the federal Clery Act. UIC Police may also issue notifications for off-campus crimes in the interest of public-safety awareness. Security tips are standard precautions, not special or incident-specific measures. Offender descriptions and precise locations are provided only to aid in the identification of possible suspects. Updates to investigations are not sent by email but will be posted online at: http://emergency.uic.edu/public-safety-advisory/  UIC Annual Security Report  Chicago Police Department Crime Incidents  Urgent notifications may be sent via both INSTANT TEXT MESSAGE (SMS) and URGENT mass e-mails. SMS messages — issued only in cases of immediate threat to health and safety, such as a tornado alert, or a major disruption to travel — are faster and more reliable than e-mail. The campus strongly recommends that you register your cell phone for SMS messages at http://sms.uic.edu                 © Copyright 2015-2020 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois      Footer Navigation   Follow Us     Disability Resources  Emergency Information  Privacy Policy  Contact Us
