Many times the best way to do that is to provide your advisor with a course description or syllabus for the courses you are interested in. If you need additional information to have your courses approved, please contact us .  Course Descriptions  Official course descriptions are available on UIC Undergraduate Course Descriptions . This page contains descriptions for all courses offered at UIC. Not all of these courses are offered in summer. To see a list of courses being offered in the summer, go to the summer course list .  Course Syllabi  Syllabi for the upcoming summer are not usually available until shortly before the session begins. However, we are often able to provide you with syllabi from a previous semester to assist you with your course selection. These syllabi can be shared with advisors for a more detailed description of the content and methods taught in a particular course, though they will not be the exact syllabi that will be used in the upcoming summer. If you would like previous semester syllabi, contact us .         Have a question? Chat live with Summer Session Staff!
