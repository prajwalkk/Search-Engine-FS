Visit the UIC Police Department at 943 W. Maxwell Street.  Submit the Complaint form electronically.   While anonymous complaints will be accepted, please note that this sometimes reduces the ability to gather all relevant facts upon which to make decisions about any given employee’s behavior.  All filed complaints will be handled in accordance with the Uniform Police Officers Disciplinary Act.       Uniform Officers Disciplinary Act   In accordance with 50 ILCS 725 – Uniform Peace Officers Disciplinary Act,  It is the policy of the UIC Police Department to investigate alleged misconduct in a manner that ensures objectivity, fairness, and justice and must be consistent with the legal rights due to them.  State law requires that any person making an allegation of misconduct against a University of Illinois Police Officer sign a sworn affidavit that certifies that the allegation is true and correct. If the person making the complaint did not actually witness the alleged conduct, they must certify that they believe that the facts in the allegation are true.   Illinois law (50 ILCS 725/3.8) requires that anyone filing a complaint against a sworn peace officer must have the complaint supported by a sworn affidavit.  Any person who knowingly files a false complaint may be subject to criminal charges or a civil suit. A person commits perjury when, under oath or affirmation, in a proceeding or in any other matter where by law such oath or affirmation is required, he makes a false statement, material to the issue or point in question, which he does not believe to be true. Perjury is a Class 3 felony.
