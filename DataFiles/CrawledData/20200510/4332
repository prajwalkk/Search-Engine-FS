Preprofessional students in AHS can be Disability and Human Development, Kinesiology, Nutrition Science, or Rehabilitation Sciences majors. Advisors for students in pre-occupational therapy and pre-physical therapy are available in the AHS College Office of Student Affairs and the department offices. Students are also encouraged to participate in the preadmission information sessions which are held monthly within the OT and PT departments. Scheduling information for these sessions can be found on the AHS website .  Completion of the required course work or attainment of the minimum grade point average does not guarantee admission to a professional program. Pre-OT and pre-PT students must complete all the requirements for a bachelor’s degree, including a major, in addition to the preprofessional studies.  Pre-Occupational Therapy  Occupational therapists provide services to maximize the function and satisfaction of persons whose daily life performance has been interrupted and jeopardized by disease, disability, life stress, and other factors. The occupational therapist provides the individual with opportunities for involvement in carefully chosen work, play, or self-care activities. The occupational therapist also uses various methods of mutual problem solving, environmental modification, adaptive devices, technology, and biomechanical and sensorimotor treatment methods to support and enhance performance.  Many occupational therapists work within hospital settings, but there is growing emphasis on prevention and treatment of people with disabilities in nonclinical settings. As a result, many new areas of employment are now available. For example, occupational therapists are increasingly employed in school systems where they work with children with disabilities, enhancing their ability to perform as students. Working with in-home health organizations, occupational therapists help individuals and families function more adequately at daily tasks. In industrial settings, they aid workers' with disabilities or injuries return to gainful employment. In addition, occupational therapists have developed private practices.  The preprofessional course work listed below prepares students to apply to the professional program in the Department of Occupational Therapy in the College of Applied Health Sciences after completion of the undergraduate degree. Students should contact OTDept@uic.edu or (312) 413-0124 for further information.  Pre-occupational therapy students may choose any major but should work with a preprofessional advisor to plan a course of study that fulfills pre-occupational therapy studies requirements as well as the requirements for the major.

Pre-Physical Therapy  Physical therapy is a health profession whose primary purpose is the promotion of optimal human health and function through the application of scientific principles to prevent, identify, assess, correct, or alleviate acute or prolonged movement dysfunction. Physical therapy encompasses areas of specialized competence and includes the development of new principles and applications to more effectively meet existing and emerging health needs. Other professional activities that serve the purpose of physical therapy are research, education, consultation, and administration.  The physical therapist, working in cooperation with other health professionals, serves the individual needs of the client and the health needs of society. The physical therapy profession depends heavily on knowledge and application of the basic medical and behavioral sciences, coupled with specialized knowledge and skills in the clinical arts and sciences.  Physical therapists may work as staff, supervisors, or self-employed practitioners who serve clients directly; as administrators of clinical departments, health agencies, or educational programs; as healthcare agency consultants; as clinical or academic teachers; or as researchers.  They may work in hospitals, clinics, rehabilitation centers, schools for children with disabilities, neighborhood health centers, physicians’ offices, nursing homes and convalescent centers, private and public health agencies, sports settings, and universities.  Pre-physical therapy students may choose any major but should work with an advisor to plan a course of study that fulfills the pre-physical therapy studies requirements as well as the requirements for the major. Students are advised to declare an educational goal of pre-physical therapy upon entering UIC which will alert them to specific workshops and other pertinent information.  The pre-physical therapy requirements follow and should be completed as part of the undergraduate degree program.
