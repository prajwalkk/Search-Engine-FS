Ragozzino    Introduction  Students interested in an education that emphasizes an understanding of human behavior should consider a major in psychology. Psychology as a major/minor can lead to a broad range of career possibilities. An education that focuses on behavior principles is valuable for anyone whose future involves interacting with others.  Psychologists pursue careers in such areas as clinical services, health services, business, industry, testing, education, and behavioral research. There are plenty of career opportunities for students with a bachelor’s degree in psychology, particularly in the areas of social work, healthcare, business, and human resources. Career opportunities in some specializations may require a master’s degree, while career opportunities in others require a doctorate. Therefore, students should take time to examine their own interests, values, and goals in addition to job requirements and career options in their area of interest before embarking on an educational journey in psychology.  The Department of Psychology offers two programs leading to the Bachelor of Arts with a Major in Psychology. A student has the option of completing a General or Applied Psychology concentration. Students may graduate with departmental distinction in either program. Both concentrations require students to take an introductory course in psychology, as well as courses in research methods and statistics.  The General Psychology concentration is appropriate for students who want to emphasize psychology within the context of a general liberal arts education. This concentration provides students with a strong base of knowledge for understanding the theories and scientific method of psychology. Many students choose this concentration when they are considering continuing their education beyond the bachelor’s level, but students go to graduate school from either concentration. The Applied Psychology concentration is designed to give a student not only a strong base in the core curriculum of psychology, but also an opportunity to gain hands-on experience in the field. Students in the Applied Psychology concentration take an additional 8 credit hours as described on the Applied Psychology Concentration page.  Students may graduate with Distinction, High Distinction, or Highest Distinction in either the Applied or General concentrations. Students who are considering attending graduate school should consider following the program for majoring with Distinction, High Distinction, or Highest Distinction. See below for details.  BA with a Major in Psychology  Majors in Psychology must complete a concentration in either General Psychology or Applied Psychology.  Preparatory Courses  Students may declare a major in Psychology at any time. The first courses students should complete are the following preparatory courses, which are prerequisites for enrollment in many upper-level psychology courses.   Course List         Code  Title  Hours     Courses  PSCH 100 Introduction to Psychology a 4  PSCH 242 Introduction to Research in Psychology 3  ENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Writing for Inquiry and Research 3  One of the following courses:  MATH 090 Intermediate Algebra  MATH 118 Mathematical Reasoning (or the equivalent or higher)    a This course is approved for the Understanding the Individual and Society General Education category.  Students must earn a minimum 2.40/4.00 GPA in these courses AND receive a grade of C or higher in each of the four courses. Students who do not meet these requirements will be put on probation in the major. To be reinstated to full status in the major, students must (a) retake the course(s) in which they scored less than a C and earn a C or higher in that course(s), and (b) if that does not raise their GPA in the 4 preparatory courses to 2.40, students must also complete two other psychology courses at UIC and earn a 3.00/4.00 GPA. Students must complete those two additional courses within one semester of being notified that they are on probation. If a student has completed additional psychology courses while taking the four required preparatory courses, those additional courses will be counted in the calculation of the GPA to remove the student from probation.  Distinction  Departmental Distinction  In addition to completing the degree requirements for either the General or Applied concentration, a candidate for Departmental Distinction must earn a 3.50/4.00 cumulative GPA in psychology courses and a 3.40/4.00 cumulative overall GPA. The GPA will be calculated using all of the credits that are being applied to the degree—from UIC and from any transfer institution. The actual awarding of distinction is made when credentials are evaluated for graduation.  High Departmental Distinction  In addition to completing the degree requirements for either the General or Applied concentration, the candidate for High Departmental Distinction must meet the requirements for Departmental Distinction. The candidate must also complete PSCH 443 and either one additional laboratory course in psychology ( PSCH 313 , PSCH 321 , PSCH 331 , PSCH 333 , PSCH 351 , PSCH 353 , PSCH 361 , PSCH 363 , PSCH 367 ) or 3 hours of PSCH 396 . The actual awarding of distinction is made when credentials are evaluated for graduation.  Highest Departmental Distinction  In addition to completing the degree requirements for either the General or Applied concentration, the candidate for Highest Departmental Distinction must meet the requirements for Departmental Distinction. The candidate must also complete PSCH 443 and an independent research project in PSCH 399 (3 credits), under the supervision of a faculty advisor.  The proposal for a Highest Distinction independent research project should be submitted to the Psychology Department Advising Office after approval by the faculty advisor and the Director of Undergraduate Studies. The student’s final report of the independent research project must be reviewed by the Departmental Reading Committee. The form for proposing this project is available in the Psychology Department Advising Office and online. The actual awarding of distinction is made when credentials are evaluated for graduation.
