We consider diversity a strength that contributes to the success of our students, staff, faculty, and institutional research. UIC has developed major climate commitment goals and short-term action items that the campus will implement to address climate change, including teaching and learning opportunities in sustainability.  The following groups are tasked to ensure neither diminished state support nor a more challenging financial environment deters us from our commitment to diversity and confronting the challenges of climate change and sustainability on campus.       Committee on Sustainability and Energy (CCSE)   The Chancellor’s Committee on Sustainability and Energy is a voluntary committee that works to promote sustainability on UIC’s campus and advance UIC’s Climate Commitment of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050.  Membership to CCSE is open to UIC staff, faculty and students.    CCSE Website         Status Committees   UIC established the Chancellor’s Status Committees to assist the campus community in supporting our diverse students, faculty and staff. Every year, faculty, staff, and students are nominated by existing committee members and appointed annually by the Chancellor as an official executive committee member. Their participation reflects the importance of service to the university and reflects the diversity of our campus. Involvement in Status Committee meetings and events is open to the entire UIC community and supported by the Chancellor thereby considered approved for employee participation.
