The objective was to develop a comprehensive strategic plan that identifies the guiding principles and future vision of UI COM and establishes a clear path for executing on those plans. The strategic plan aims to define how UI COM is organized across various campuses and functions within the academic enterprise, while clarifying the identity, brand, and market positioning for the college.  The college explored ways to increase organizational alignment by developing a clear set of cross-campus strategic priorities. The resulting plan took into consideration the market dynamics and subculture of several academic and medical communities and ensured that the emerging strategies of UI COM and UI Hospital & Clinics were integrated with one another with respect to the Chicago market. The strategic plan positions UI COM to effectively excel in medical education, research, care delivery, and public service in the increasingly unpredictable environment of academic medicine.  The Key components of a strategic plan are: Mission, Vision and Values; Goals; Measurable Outcomes; Strategic Initiatives; and Tactics.
