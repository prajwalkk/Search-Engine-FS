Upon completion, graduates are eligible to pursue board certification through the American Board of Pediatric Dentistry (ABPD). Graduates have a track record of strong performance on the written and oral ABPD examinations.  The program provides a rich and diversified educational experience that emphasizes comprehensive oral health care for healthy and medically complex infants, children and adolescents. Its renovated, state-of-the-art graduate clinic with 20 operatories (8 of which are private rooms), attends to a large and diverse population of the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois. Each operatory is equipped with nitrous oxide, digital radiography, a video monitor and a computer. There is an optimal ratio of dental assistants to residents. Residents graduate with significant experience providing care using different modalities of behavior management, including nitrous oxide, moderate sedation (oral and intranasal) and general anesthesia.  The department has a diverse and rich clinical faculty that includes 7 full-time and 6 part-time clinical faculty members who are pediatric dentists. In addition, our faculty includes individuals from behavioral sciences, orthodontics, and public health. Physicians and dental specialists from other departments also contribute to teaching in the program in an interdisciplinary format.  The program emphasizes public health and provision of care for the underserved. We have a HRSA grant to support a 36-month Certificate/MS/MPH program that will end in June 2020. If we are successful in receiving a renewal grant, there will be two positions available for this track. The remaining seven positions will be the 24- month Certificate/MS track. Applicants interested in an MPH are strongly encouraged to contact the Program Director.   Program  The Department of Pediatric Dentistry will accept up to 9 residents into the 2021 entering class.  All positions will be awarded through the Dental Match Service.  2-year Certificate Program . The department offers a 2-year Certificate program with a required integrated Master of Science (MS) in Oral Sciences.  ​ Curriculum  The program is designed to fully prepare the resident for clinical practice, as well as to provide educational opportunities for those who desire to pursue a teaching, public health or research career in pediatric dentistry.  Learning modalities include didactic courses, seminars, continuing education courses, and clinical experiences. The curriculum includes, among others: behavior management, child development and psychology, pulp therapy, orthodontics/growth & development, oral care for special health care needs patients/hospital dentistry, dental traumatology, biostatistics, epidemiology and research methods, dental radiology, pediatric oral pathology, dental materials, cariology/microbiology, infant oral health and prevention, advocacy, practice management, inherited and acquired dental anomalies, and principles of sedation and general anesthesia. The program offers a specially-designed seminar on leadership development and advocacy for residents. Additional topics are covered in rounds and in a seminar format. Many biomedical topics are covered in the MS in Oral Sciences Core Curriculum, which are completed with residents in other specialties.  Clinical experiences primarily occur in the pediatric dentistry graduate clinic at the UIC College of Dentistry. Our facilities offer collaboration and consultation with professionals from other departments within the College of Dentistry and other health sciences. Dental care under general anesthesia, after-hours emergency dental care, and rotations in pediatric and subspeciality medical clinics (Cardiology, Hematology/Oncology, General Pediatrics, Anesthesiology, Emergency Medicine, Craniofacial clinic, etc.) take place at the University of Illinois Hospital which is conveniently located adjacent to the College of Dentistry. Construction is nearly complete for a "Pediatric Dentistry Outpatient Care Center" to provide in-office general anesthesia to supplement the operating room experiences at UI Hospital. The residents also rotate in the Department of Oral Surgery at the College to observe complex pediatric and adult oral surgery cases done under intravenous sedation. Our busy undergraduate pediatric dental clinic provides an excellent venue for both clinical and lab teaching of dental students. Residents receive clinical and didactic orthodontic experiences in the Mixed Dentition Clinic, which is a collaboration with the Department of Orthodontics.  Second-year residents may receive additional general anesthesia experience at St. Bernard Hospital and provide care at community-based health clinics.  Program Stipend and Tuition  The program awards graduates with a Certificate in the Specialty of Pediatric Dentistry. Graduate Medical Education (GME) residents receive a competitive stipend for the duration of the certificate program. For 2020-2021, the first-year stipend is $58,716, and the second-year stipend is $60,780, plus health coverage and fringe benefits. Each July,  there may be a small increase to the stipend. There are no tuition fees for enrollment in the Certificate program. Note that eligibility for a GME stipend is determined by GME policies and not by the residency program.  A Master of Science in Oral Sciences degree is required and is integrated in the 24-month program. Tuition for the Master's program is waived, up to $5,250 annually for the first 2 years, but it is taxed.  Accepted residents must plan to be in Chicago by mid-June for mandatory GME, College of Dentistry, and Program orientation prior to the program start.
