Refusal is not a practical option, as data collection is an inherent condition of many essential societal transactions. One vernacular response to this regime of everyday surveillance is obfuscation. With a variety of possible motivations, actors engage in obfuscation by producing misleading, false, or ambiguous data with the intention of confusing an adversary or simply adding to the time or cost of separating bad data from good. Linking contemporary and historical cases, from radar chaff to BitTorrent , my talk addresses political and ethical challenges to obfuscation tactics. It also stakes out foundations for a possible science of obfuscation.
