The ITGC is the principal group that drives the IT governance process.  The functional crosscutting committees ( Education , Research , Infrastructure and Security , and Administration ) report to the ITGC, and in turn the ITGC reports to the Provost. It advises the Provost and the UIC CIO.  The governance committees are the voice of the campus for IT related matters. The expectation is that all committee members are in communication with their colleagues and units. Unit concerns related to IT should be brought forward to committees. Members should relay committee discussions back to their units. The ITGC is responsible for addressing IT issues on campus and working to correct them.  The responsibilities assigned to UIC’s ITGC are to recommend and monitor:     IT Policies  Strategic Directions  Resource Allocation  Collaboration  Standards and Procedures  Transparency  Performance Measures     The purpose of the ITGC is to:     Create a process for evaluating and prioritizing major IT initiatives  Administer the overall campus IT governance process  Evaluate and recommend the creation, adoption and implementation, changes or updates of IT policies  Improve communication of IT policy  Ensure that information is available on the IT hardware, software and services available at UIC  Provide adequate and appropriate education, research, and administrative IT services and infrastructure  Evaluate and recommend IT funding levels, models and mechanisms  Evaluate the profile of the purchase of commodity IT hardware and software and make recommendations  Ensure that core services are provided in a robust, reliable, efficient and consistent manner  Ensure that UIC users are supported in a coordinated manner through IT decentralization, department contributions to IT services, and collaboration among centralized IT services  Evaluate and make recommendations for IT to improve IT training and professional development opportunities  Create a UIC IT strategic plan that aligns with UIC campus priorities  Coordinate the development and publication of college-level and campus-level IT plans and performance measurements  Develop governance practices that clearly differentiate and assign responsibility for governance, service delivery and departmental roles  Ensure that the planning and governance process is recurring with appropriate performance measures and regular reviews for effectiveness  Ensure college-level IT is able and encouraged to make optimal use of central IT services  Ensure that the governance model will leverage the information assets of UIC, reduce expenditures and improve operations  Ensure that an effective program is in place to manage the relationships between IT providers and the constituents that make up the UIC community  Provide necessary IT support for cross-campus programs  Work with Hospital and UTMT on IT-related issues     This list will be reviewed periodically to ensure relevancy.  The ITGC should aim at developing a shared service model that contains the elements of price transparency, service culture, good business process, standardization, continuous improvement and responsiveness, while providing an environment that encourages innovation and leadership in technology at all levels.
