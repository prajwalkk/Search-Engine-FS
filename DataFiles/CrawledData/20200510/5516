Will my spring 2020 courses that transfer with CR/P (Credit or Pass) grades be applied to degree requirements the same as if they were letter grades? For courses completed in the spring 2020 term only, grades of CR/P (Credit or Pass) will satisfy requirements where a minimum letter grade is required and will count toward degree completion. Assuming that a transfer course has been articulated to match the UIC course in question, there is no difference between the treatment of a transfer course or a course completed at UIC.  Please visit Transferology.com to see how your courses will transfer to UIC.  For courses completed in the Spring 2020 term only, courses used to satisfy the Illinois Articulation Initiative's General Education Core Curriculum ( IAI GECC ) with grades of CR/P (Credit or Pass) will be used to satisfy UIC general education requirements.  Students may transfer as many courses completed in Spring 2020 as they wish for CR grading and these courses will not count toward the number of courses or credit hours students can earn under the CR/NC (Credit / No Credit) option in one term or in total.
