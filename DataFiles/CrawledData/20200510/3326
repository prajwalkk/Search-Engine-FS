CS Theory at UIC  Theoretical Computer Science Group at UIC       At UIC, the mathematical
    computer science group in the department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science (MSCS) and the
departments of Computer Science (CS) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) are home to a lively theory presence.
Our unique structure helps facilitate regular collaborations between the theory
faculty and a diverse number of both computer scientists and mathematicians.
