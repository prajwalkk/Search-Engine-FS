The PharmD is the highest level of professional education in pharmacy and has been approved by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) as the sole entry-level degree for the profession.  The PharmD curriculum at UIC emphasizes a patient-centered course of study and provides a structure that will enable students to develop into reflective practitioners with skills and attitudes to anticipate change, criticize, evaluate, and modify practice in a changing healthcare arena. The curriculum also provides a fundamental core of knowledge, skills, and attitudes, which in composite, promote the fulfillment of the adopted professional competencies for a generalist practitioner who delivers pharmaceutical care.
