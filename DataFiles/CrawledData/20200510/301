Yet increasingly, a great deal of uncertainty pervades the design and execution of software, and also the way software is tested, analyzed and verified. Much of my research over the past decade has focused on addressing problems related to uncertainty. Some of this research involves work with probabilistic model checking, which is a quantitative approach to verification that attempts to avoid the simplistic true/false, satisfied/violated mindset of traditional verification. Other research has looked at problems in the engineering of context-aware ubiquitous computing systems, whose execution is driven strongly by unpredictable phenomena sensed in the systems? execution environment, with the sensing itself adding uncertainty in various ways. In this talk I will discuss the issue of uncertainty in software engineering and will give a tour of some my research on dealing with uncertainty.       Bio:   David S. Rosenblum is Professor of Computer Science and Dean of the School of Computing at the National University of Singapore, where he also directs the Felicitous Computing Institute. He received his PhD from Stanford University in 1988, and he has been a research scientist at AT&T Bell Laboratories (Murray Hill), Associate Professor at the University of California, Irvine, Principal Architect and Chief Technology Officer of PreCache (a technology startup funded by Sony Music), and Professor of Software Systems at University College London. His research interests are centered on problems in the design, analysis and testing of large-scale distributed software systems and ubiquitous computing systems. In the past decade he served as General Chair of the 2007 International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2007) and Program Co-Chair of the 2004 International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2004). He is currently the Editor-in-Chief of the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (ACM TOSEM), and was previously an Associate Editor of ACM TOSEM and the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (IEEE TSE). In 2002 he received the ICSE Most Influential Paper Award for his ICSE 1992 paper on assertion checking, and in 2008 he received the first ACM SIGSOFT Impact Paper Award with Alexander L. Wolf for their ESEC/FSE 1997 paper on Internet-scale event notification. He has been the recipient of an NSF CAREER grant in the USA and a Wolfson Research Merit Award from the Royal Society in the UK. He is a Fellow of the ACM and IEEE and a Senior Member of the Singapore Computer Society, and he is the Past Chair of the ACM Special Interest Group in Software Engineering (ACM SIGSOFT).
