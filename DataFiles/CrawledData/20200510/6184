Get more information about the National Board Dental Examination (NBDE) .  Please note that the American Dental Association (ADA) will be implementing the Integrated National Board Dental Examination (INBDE) beginning on August 1, 2020.  The INBDE is intended to replace the National Board Dental Examination (INBDE) parts I and II. Please visit the ADA's website for additional details on the INBDE timeline.  After August 1, 2020, the UIC College of Dentistry will accept both the INBDE and the NBDE part I and part II as part of the application process.    ECE Course-by-Course Evaluation  A highly competitive comprehensive Grade Point Average (GPA) per the ECE course-by-course evaluation is required.
