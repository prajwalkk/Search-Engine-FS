children     Video: Excellence in Children's Oral Health Care    The Department of Pediatric Dentistry provides pre-doctoral and post-doctoral training in comprehensive oral health care for pediatric patients. The Department operates a general pediatric clinic, and a specialty pediatric clinic in conjunction with the University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System. Faculty provides leadership in the field by conducting research and other scholarly activity. The mission of our two unique pediatric dental clinics reflects our belief that children deserve the best of oral health care. We offer a full spectrum of services for all children at every stage of their lives from infancy through adolescence including those with special and complex oral health needs, and patients with special developmental and behavioral care needs. Our clinics provide comprehensive oral health examinations, teeth cleaning, fluoride treatments, sealants, restorative procedures (fillings, crowns, etc.), extractions and minor surgical procedures, space-maintainers, athletic mouth guard, teeth whitening (for adolescents), interceptive orthodontic when applicable, and urgent care (trauma, infection, etc.). These services can be completed using inhalation sedation (Nitrous oxide), moderate sedation, and general anesthesia.  Our Faculty  The Department has a diverse and rich clinical faculty that includes 6 full-time and 8 part-time clinical faculty members who are pediatric dentists. In addition to pediatric dentists, our faculty includes psychologists, behavioral scientists, a statistician, an epidemiologist, an orthodontist, and public health experts. Physicians and dental specialists from other departments also contribute to teaching in the program.
