License practical nurses (LPN) need to complete 20 hours of approved continuing education contact hours. The next LPN licensure renewal is due by Jan. 31, 2021.  Registered nurses (RN) need to complete 20 hours of approved continuing education contact hours. The next RN licensure renewal is due by Sept. 30, 2020 (extension granted by the IDFPR).  Advanced practice register nurses (APRN) need to complete 80 hours of approved continuing education contact hours. The next APRN licensure renewal is due by Sept. 30, 2020 (extension granted by the IDFPR).

A new requirement for Sexual Harassment Prevention Training was issued by the Division of Professional Regulation and is now in effect as of Jan. 1, 2020 for all professional licensure renewals including nursing (LPN, RN, APRN).   The requirement is that any individual who has a licensed issued by the Division of Professional Regulation must complete a one-hour continuing education on sexual harassment prevention training for every renewal period.  This will be part of the required number of contact hours per licensure renewal, and not an increase in required continuing education hours to complete.
