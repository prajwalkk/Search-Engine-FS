Holmes began her career as an Engineering Analyst at Sargent & Lundy in the Structural Analytical Division of the Structural Department where for 18 years she helped develop computer programs used to determine the magnitude and effects of loads on structures in nuclear and fossil plants caused by earthquakes and worked or supervised work on all phases of the life cycle of computer programs used for soil structure interaction, generation of response spectra, analysis of cable tray and HVAC hangers, and piping systems. She continued working part-time after that as a consultant modifying the program used to analyze piping systems until she retired in 2018.  Nancy holds a BS in structural design, an MS in mechanics and materials, and a PhD in engineering from UIC College of Engineering and is a third-generation registered professional engineer. She has been an active member of Engineers Without Borders for 11 years and recently traveled to Guatemala and Honduras on teams to help build bridges and sanitation systems. Nancy is an avid supporter of the UIC College of Engineering, having established a merit-based scholarship 12 years ago for undergraduate students in civil engineering. She and her husband, Tom, live in Oak Park, have 3 children, 10 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.                    UIC Logo        Engineering Alumni       Contact   851 S.
