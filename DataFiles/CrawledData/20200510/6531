The Generalist portion of the MSW curriculum provides a generalist perspective on social work practice. Curriculum areas include social work practice, human behavior and the social environment, social work research, social welfare policy and services, and field instruction.  The Specialization portion of the MSW curriculum builds upon the foundation. Advanced curriculum content, tailored to the specialization, is provided in the areas of mental health, child and family services, organization and community practice, and school social work practice.       Field Instruction   Placements in the field are an important part of the MSW program, and provide students with hands-on, real-world experience that prepares them for practice with at-risk individuals, groups, families and communities.  The Generalist year of study requires 450 hours of field instruction, and the Specialization year requires 630 hours.
