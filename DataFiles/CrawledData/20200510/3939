Look at our awards chart for synopses of just some of the awards and honors that are reviewed and distributed by site, college and university committees and announced at UICOMP’s annual Student Recognition Event on the Thursday prior to Convocation. Up to $45,000 to $50,000 in campus-based awards are distributed to Peoria students each year. Awards are subject to change and revision. Nominations for most of these awards are solicited annually between January and March, unless otherwise noted. Eligible nominators should complete the online nomination form to nominate students for selected awards. Federal and university guidelines govern the distribution of funds monetary awards. In most cases, the UIC Accounts Receivable and Financial Aid Offices will determine how a monetary award is to be disbursed. Each recipient is considered on an individual basis. Generous contributions by donors to the College of Medicine have created a roster of “Endowed Awards” for our students. To learn more about our endowed awards, and how to contribute to scholarships for students, visit our Giving Funds page and browse by fund name. Information on “external” awards to which students can apply directly is regularly compiled and distributed by the UICOMP Office of Student Affairs or by the UICOM Financial Aid Office.
