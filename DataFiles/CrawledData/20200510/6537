Gifts can be cash – payable online with a credit card as a one-time or recurring gift, or by check payable to UI Foundation/JACSW. Gifts of securities, IRA rollover contributions, and donations from Donor Advised Funds are also accepted. You decide what works best for you given your current situation and giving preferences; we’re always available to assist you and answer your questions.  Annual Gifts  Unrestricted Gifts to the Annual Fund are a powerful form of giving that allows JACSW to apply the funds where needs are the greatest. Your gift supports a wide range of initiatives, such as student scholarships, special lectures, seminars, student travel to professional conferences, graduate student research, and so much more.  Gifts to Scholarship Funds (Jane Addams College’s Number One Priority for the IGNITE Campaign) provide annual scholarship support for students in need of financial assistance. Many of our students work part- or full-time, support families, and enter graduate school with student loan debt. More scholarship dollars translate into increased access for students from all financial backgrounds who have the desire to serve others through a career in social work, as well as less of a financial burden upon graduation. You can give to any or all of these scholarship and student funds including:   Jane Addams College of Social Work Scholarship Fund  Jane Addams College of Social Work Student Emergency Fund (new special fund)  The Professor James P. Gleeson Endowed Scholarship Fund  The Class of 1973 Endowed Scholarship Fund  The Class of 1990 Scholarship Fund   Gifts to JACSW Research Centers  JACSW is home to two outstanding research centers. Your gifts to the centers support the infrastructure needed to conduct research and provide programs and services promoting social, racial, and economic justice.   The Center for Social Policy and Research conducts research and evaluation studies, analyzes public policies, disseminates research findings, and tests new program models and service delivery strategies. In addition, it provides assistance to organizational leaders in implementing policy directives. The criminal justice system, human rights, and health equity provide the focus for most Center work.  The Midwest Latino Health Research, Training, and Policy Center is devoted to improving the health and quality of health-care delivery to Hispanics/Latinos and other underserved populations. It does this by engaging in quantitative and qualitative health disparities research, training, policy work, and education and mobilization at the grassroots level. The Center’s research agenda focuses on topics in minority health and has become nationally known through its training program for diabetes management, Diabetes Empowerment Education Program (DEEP).

Impact the Future   Endowed Funds  You can create a permanent legacy and a source of funding for a program, scholarship, center, or faculty position by establishing a named endowed fund. An endowed fund maintains a permanent corpus (your gift) that is carefully managed by the University of Illinois Foundation to maximize returns. On an annual basis a portion of the interest received from the endowed fund is used for your designated purpose. For example, an endowed scholarship fund established at the minimum gift level of $25,000 provides approximately a $1,000 scholarship to a student on an annual basis, and can be even more as the fund grows over time. Endowments can be funded with several different giving instruments and can be paid over a pledge period.  Planned Gifts  Planned gifts are gift arrangements that accommodate your personal and family priorities while providing the college financial support. They usually have specific tax advantages and include deferred gifts and gifts that can provide lifetime income to a beneficiary or beneficiaries named by the donor. One of the most common and easy to set up planned gifts is a charitable bequest in your will or trust. You can ask your attorney to change your will or revocable trust, or sign a new beneficiary designation for your retirement plan, insurance policy, or IRA. Your gift can be specified as a stated sum of cash or as a percentage of the value of your estate. Bequests can also include property or real estate.  Questions About Endowments and Planned Giving?
