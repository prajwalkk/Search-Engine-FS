The study of the various mathematical sciences involves learning ideas and techniques essential for the natural and social sciences and is increasingly important in all areas of a technological society.  Occupational fields open to students who have completed one of the curricula or majors in the department include mathematical analysis in industry or government, teaching, research, actuarial (insurance) work, computer programming and other statistical work, and mathematical aspects of business and finance.  The Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science offers programs leading to the Bachelor of Science with a Major in Mathematics, the Bachelor of Science in the Teaching of Mathematics, the Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science, and the Bachelor of Science with a Major in Statistics. A Minor in Mathematics and a Minor in Mathematics and Computer Science are also offered. Each major is assigned a department advisor who approves the student’s choice of courses.  Transfer Students  A transfer student majoring in one of these programs must successfully complete at least half of the mathematics courses in residence at UIC. For the BS with a Major in Mathematics, at least 12 semester hours must be at the advanced level; for the BS in Mathematics and Computer Science, 14 semester hours must be upper division. No transfer course below calculus may be counted toward the BS with a Major in Mathematics, the BS in the Teaching of Mathematics, the BS in Mathematics and Computer Science, or the BS with a Major in Statistics. Only grades of A, B, or C in calculus and above from other colleges and universities will be accepted for transfer credit.  Admission Requirements  Students must have concurrent registration in MATH 180 , or equivalent standing, as a requirement for declaration of a major in any departmental program.  Distinction  For consideration, the student must have a minimum of a 3.50/4.00 GPA in upper-division courses in the department.
