The homepage featured the endangered Grevy’s zebra, an animal whose population Wildbook has aimed to help conserve using AI and crowd-sourced photography. Wildbook is a part of Wild Me , an established non-profit that Berger-Wolf oversees with her team of conservation enthusiasts. The group has helped take a more accurate census of thousands of endangered species, including giraffes, elephants, and whale sharks, among others.  In addition to the featured image, Bing hosted a three-question quiz for users to test their zebra knowledge. Wildbook’s collaboration with Bing stems from its relationship with parent company Microsoft.  Microsoft recently announced Wild Me as one of their five featured projects for its AI for Earth initiative, which includes a $50 million commitment toward utilizing AI to help protect the planet and its inhabitants.      story title        Visit Wildbook          Take Quiz          Modified on August 12, 2019                  UIC Logo         College of  Engineering            Contact   College of Engineering  851 S.
