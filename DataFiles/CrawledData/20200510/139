Research is conducted in nearly 100 faculty-run laboratories and in several interdisciplinary college-wide research centers.  UIC Engineering research is sponsored by the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Departments of Defense and Energy, Argonne National Laboratory, multinational corporations, and more. Our dedication to research and our location in metropolitan Chicago makes UIC a sought-after destination for emerging researchers. Faculty hired within the last decade have earned their doctorates at Brown, Caltech, Carnegie Mellon, Columbia, Georgia Tech, Harvard, Michigan, MIT, Princeton, Stanford, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the University of Southern California, among others.       faculty tidbits     195 faculty members   Including 43 NSF CAREER award recipients and 89 fellowships in professional societies.     $94 million   Research and development grants in force, spanning six departments and 232 projects.
