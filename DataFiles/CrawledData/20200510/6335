Students will be asked to rank their top two campuses when they accept the offer for admission. Campus assignment will be shared via the applicant portal after notice of formal acceptance.  Factors considered for campus assignment are in alignment with the specific mission of each campus and include, but are not limited to, where the student interviewed and the content of the application. The college makes every effort to assign admitted students to their first choice of campus;however, it is not always possible. Admitted students who do not receive their first choice of campus, and wish to be considered for campus re-assignment, should send a request to [email protected] . The request should contain compelling reasons to justify a potential change of campus. The Office of Medical College Admissions cannot guarantee that requests will be granted since changes in assignments are based on availability of seats at the desired campus. Requests are reviewed on an ongoing basis until the class at each site is finalized. Those admitted students who have submitted a campus re-assignment request will receive a response from the Office of Medical College Admissions in the form of an email and, in the case of a change, an update to the acceptance portal.
