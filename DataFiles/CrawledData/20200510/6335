Fund number: (331331)  Group Practice Clinic Renovation Fund The College’s present clinical operatories are more than 35 years old and lack the new technology that can be found in today’s dental practice. In order to transform the dental curriculum from the old lecture and solo practitioner model to today’s research-based collaborative model, the College is committed to renovating each of the operatories in our Group Practice Clinics. Each operatory will be state-of-the-art and will include a new dental chair and other equipment, cabinetry, and a chair-side computer. The computer technology will link the dental student to AxiUm, the College’s patient records system, and also will allow the benefit of digital radiography.

Fund number: (339431)    DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRIC DENTISTRY  Pediatric Dentistry Clinic Renovation Fund With facilities more than 35-years-old, the Department of Pediatric Dentistry has plans for a remodeled 24-chair Postgraduate Clinic. The need for new and redesigned facilities is crucial not only to meet modern HIPPA standards but also for patient privacy and to allow parents to accompany children in an effort to make the children feel safer and calmer. A reconfigured Postgraduate Clinic would include room for clinical research on oral health disparities and other pediatric dentistry research issues. A new design is necessary to duplicate private practices, which will allow each resident to manage a multiple-chair module system. An antiquated ventilation system and lighting must be replaced. Larger Sedation Rooms are needed, as is a Monitoring/Recovery Room with modern comforts and technology. The Emergency Room was not designed for the current volume of cases, and new crash carts are needed for emergency resuscitation equipment and pharmaceuticals. A redesigned Infant and Adolescent Emergency Care Unit will allow for triage and more efficient handling of emergencies. A resource Seminar Room will cluster pre-diagnostic and diagnostic technology, including digital cephalometric x-rays. A remodeled Reception Room will feature glass walls to contain children and a welcoming design with electronics and toys to keep children occupied. Desks for the residents are more than 20 years old, so modern desks with new computers are required. The Postgraduate Clinic will need private support of $1.5 million. Naming opportunities are the Emergency Care Unit, $100,000; Reception Room, $100,000; Seminar Room, $50,000; two Sedation Rooms at $35,000 each; Monitoring/Recovery Room at $35,000; 24 new operatories at $25,000 each; and 14 new desks with computers at $5,000 each. Fund number: (330973)  Pediatric Dentistry Unrestricted Fund The Pediatric Dentistry Unrestricted Fund helps the department graduate outstanding pediatric dentists, and these funds are essential to support the College’s top-level pediatric dentistry teaching, research, and public service. The Pediatric Dentistry Unrestricted Fund provides funds for residents and faculty to attend local and national dental and research meetings; helps residents with their Board prep courses; pays for surveys; provides stipends to outside guest speakers; and funds special events–even those as basic as resident interviews and our graduation ceremony. (330542)  Gerlach-Barber Recognition Fund Named the first superintendent of the College's Children's Clinic in 1927, Dr. Elsie Gerlach stayed for 38 years and became nationally known and respected as a pioneer in the teaching and development of pediatric dentistry. Dr. Tom Barber, a faculty member from 1950 to 1969, was one of the first pediatric dentistry researchers and teachers to address preventive orthodontics and was the first to introduce tape-slide presentations in dental technique training. He and Dr. Earl Renfroe wrote a seminal artical on preventive and interceptive orthodontics in 1957. The fund helps meet general needs of the Department of Pediatric Dentistry. Fund number: (331775)  Childrens’ Associated Care Fund The UIC College of Dentistry provides approximately $2 million in uncompensated oral healthcare to indigent and underserved people, most of them children.

It will be used to stimulate student interest in research, giving students an opportunity to work creatively, develop excellence, and be inspired by researchers with whom they will work. Fund number: (335354)    DEPARTMENT OF RESTORATIVE DENTISTRY  Restorative Dentistry Unrestricted Fund For DDS students and postgrads who have an interest in Restorative Dentistry, this fund supports their travel to academic meetings, the purchase of academic journals, outside speakers coming to lecture on Restorative Dentistry, and various special projects and needs vital to making the UIC College of Dentistry’s Department of Restorative Dentistry the very best. Fund number: (333555)  Restorative And Advanced Prosthodontics Clinic Renovation Fund With older facilities that need to be replaced, the Department of Restorative Dentistry has plans for a new 18-chair Advanced Prosthodontics Clinic and remodeled laboratories. The Advanced Prosthodontics Clinic was last remodeled in the early 1990s. It features 12 chairs located in close, cramped proximity to each other–an unfriendly, stress-inducing environment for patients. Remodeling will result in 18 chairs placed to meet modern HIPPA standards for patient privacy and to provide room to allow collaborative consultation between faculty, residents, and dental students that will mirror modern collaborative dental practice. Modern technology is required for the Advanced Prosthodontics Clinic, as CAD/CAM (computerized design) units and digital imaging equipment allowing rapid scanning for diagnostic purposes have become standard in modern prosthodontic practice. Laboratory areas are more than 30 years old, lack proper equipment, are not configured to modern federal regulations and requirements, and must be remodeled as well. With the College’s emphasis on research as an integral part of the curriculum, there must be laboratory space for every resident. Fund number: (337408)  Dr. S. Sol Flores & Mrs. Cecelia T. Flores Clinical Prosthodontics Laboratory Dr. S. Sol “Sam” Flores, Clinical Professor of Restorative Dentistry, has been on the faculty since the late 1940s. During World War II, Dr. Flores saw action in the Far East and survived the Bataan Death March while Mrs. Flores was a U.S. Army nurse. Dr. Flores was the first Filipino faculty member at the University of Illinois. The fund keeps the Flores Clinical Prosthodontics Laboratory, where students make dental appliances and other restorations, in state-of-the-art working order and updated with the latest equipment. Fund number: (332805)    RESEARCH  Dentistry Summer Student Research Award Fund The Dentistry Summer Student Research Award Fund supports dental students who may have an interest in research, providing stipends the summer before their D-1 year. It provides students with the research experience that will help them in their decision to become research scientists, faculty, or practicing dentists with an increased understanding of science. Fund number: (340345)  Center For Wound Healing And Tissue Regeneration Fund New research suggests that scientists might soon find improved ways to assist humans in regenerating lost tissue, including skin, mucosa, bone, teeth, organs, digits, and even limbs. The Center for Wound Healing and Tissue Regeneration is a unique community of more than 50 scientists and clinicians devoted the study of injury responses and tissue regeneration. Gifts to this fund will be used to support our multidisciplinary research team as we learn more about the body's reaction to damage, its repair process, and the elements that are needed to fully regenerate missing tissues. The ultimate goal of Center research efforts is to implement innovative therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcomes when tissues are lost due to trauma or disease. Fund number: (335098)  Research Development and Graduate Education Fund This fund supports faculty and student research projects at the College of Dentistry.
