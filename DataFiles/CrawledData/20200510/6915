Our vision is that studying content in context, with the right linkages to text-based curricula, can best develop and enhance the critical literacies students need for success regardless of academic discipline: comprehension skills of drawing inferences, finding the main idea, making analogies, resolving contradiction, and distinguishing fact from opinion.  Our goal is to provide access to a variety of international academic programming opportunities and remain committed to making overseas study and international cultural immersion an integral part of the undergraduate educational experience, better preparing students to meet the challenges and opportunities of an increasingly global society.  The how, when, where, and why  Students choose to go abroad for a whole range of academic and non-academic reasons.  Because they remain registered in coursework abroad if they go through the Study Abroad Office, it’s usually a combination of these.  Helping the student think about their motivations and then be able to make the right curricular and personal choices will be important for a successful experience abroad.  Study Abroad staff are always available for any questions or clarifications.  The Study Abroad Office is the primary gateway at UIC for undergraduates wanting to study abroad.  We are a staff of professional international educators who collectively speak several languages, have breadth and depth in cross-cultural experience and learning environments, and have an administrative system of protocols to move the student through advising, enrollment, and final transcripting.  We have strong relationships with over thirty-five domestic and international universities and academic consortia. Since 2007, students studying abroad have been supported by over $1 million of scholarship and grant funding.  The Study Abroad Office is also an administrative unit with clear protocols around student affairs and safety/ risk management issues.  We represent the best of the university parameters to both support and protect the student while they are abroad as a registered UIC student.  We are the main university unit liaison for the UI system-wide international health insurance plan. We are full members of the Forum on Education Abroad, recognized by the US Department of Justice as a standards development organization for best practice in international education.  Requirements   Eligibility Students are eligible to submit an application to study abroad through SAO only if they:  are currently enrolled at UIC  have completed a minimum of 12 hours at UIC at the time of application  are in good academic standing  Students are eligible to apply to a specific study abroad program if they meet the criteria above and:  have completed the SAO application form  have met with their SAO Advisor have his/her support to submit a program specific application  meet all the minimum requirements of their planned study abroad program which could include course pre-requisites, GPA, language levels, and class standing.  Students are eligible to participate in a study abroad program if they meet ALL the criteria above and:  have no holds on their UIC student account  have no outstanding discipline record  have paid all applicable fees to the SAO and the program sponsor in full  have attended a pre-departure orientation session  have submitted all paperwork, including a completed Course Approval Form  Some students may technically meet all requirements but not be good candidates for study abroad.  The SAO reserves the right to not forward/support a student’s application, and subsequently not register that student for study abroad, if it believes there are issues which may cause disruption to the program.  Students also sign a ‘Conditions of Participation’ agreeing to a number of academic and behavioral guidelines while abroad.  SAO also reserves the right to withdraw a student from a program, or support their withdrawal by the program sponsor, if this agreement is disregarded by the student Course Approval Process - Course Content As part of the pre-departure application and advising process, the Study Abroad Office has developed a worksheet meant to help students with the course approval process and make sure that all the courses taken abroad will satisfy graduation requirements.  This is a critical part of the advising process so that students are absolutely clear before they go abroad what courses will (or will not) receive credit.  The SAO asks the student to obtain their DARS report (or equivalent), determine what requirements are still to be met, including hours still needed, and insert all this information into the worksheet.  This informal review by the student of their academic status toward graduation informs their decision about which program to choose abroad as well as which specific courses they may want to take.  This is then discussed with their SAO advisor and finalized on a formal Course Approval Form. SAO requires every student to complete the Course Approval Form and get appropriate faculty/college signatures for planned coursework abroad.   Each College determines who the appropriate signatory is and what the categories for credit are.  There are specific Forms for each college.  The Form then becomes part of the Supplemental Grade Report SAO forwards to the Registrar’s Office once grades are received from abroad. Without the proper signatures, students run the risk of not getting credit on return to campus.  Once abroad, the Study Abroad Office follows UIC policies regarding adding, dropping, or withdrawing from courses. Course Approval Process - Academic Credit   Students choose from a portfolio of over 200 approved academic programs .    Approved programs are for academic credit ;    Grades are earned on an A-E grading scale (no Pass/Fail or other combinations);    Grades and credit earned abroad become part of the student’s UIC transcript and are calculated in overall GPA .  All grades are considered as UIC credit, not transfer credit.    For major, minor, language not being taken as elective, and natural science credit, students must get faculty or college approval ;    For their term abroad, all SAO students are registered in one of the following rubrics as appropriate to their UIC enrollment: LAS299, BA299, ISA299, NURS299, PUBH299, UPP420, or GC491. These are  0-18 credit placeholders;    SAO applies the same registration rules regarding adding or dropping courses as on campus, i.e. there are specific timelines and retroactive course approval is a last resort only on petition.   Moving the student from interest to participation SAO Resource Room The Study Abroad Office Resource Room in 502 University Hall has an extensive collection of program information sheets, discipline charts, brochures, catalogs, and scholarship information. Our Resource Room is open 8:30 am – 4:30 pm Monday-Friday. First Step Sessions  First Step advising sessions are mandatory for all study abroad applicants as a starting point for the application process. A 20 minute First Step PowerPoint presentation will review how to select the best program for your needs, and review the application, advising, course approval and registration processes. SAO website Everything a student needs to know about programs is on our website, including site specific information, curriculum choices, syllabi, excursion possibilities, costs, and often a page with information on how to contact alumni from all over the US who have been on a particular program. Consultation Advising These sessions are for the student who wants to talk more about their program, curriculum, and/or funding options before making a decision to complete an application.  The schedule is under the First Step tab of the SAO website. Meeting with a Study Abroad Advisor Once a student has chosen a program and filled out the SAO application, they are ready to meet with an advisor in a one on one meeting.  Students can have as many meetings as they need.  Each lasts for about 30 minutes.  Ultimately the SAO advisor will sign off on the student’s application to a specific program.  Special review is required for activities in countries under a U.S. Department of State “Travel Warning.” Scholarships There are a variety of nationally competitive, regionally focused, UIC housed, and program sponsor scholarship opportunities for study abroad. In addition to the Study Abroad Office advising staff, the Office of Special Scholarships is a great resource for assistance with applications. The office is located in 2550 University Hall. Visit the Scholarship and Costs / Financial Aid page. Pre-departure Orientation These sessions are held twice each year following an application and enrollment cycle in April and November.  Students are required to attend in order to be registered for Study Abroad.  Topics covered include final checks on all application materials, international insurance, financial aid, health, safety and risk management. Transcripts All transcripts for Study Abroad students are sent by the host institution/sponsor to the Study Abroad Office for processing.  They usually arrive within a few weeks after the end of a term, but may take up to several weeks. SAO checks the credit articulation signed off on by the college/department, creates a Supplemental Grade Report, routes for signature to the appropriate college, and forwards to the Registrar’s Office for entry into DARS.  Students should check their DARS report to make sure the credit is properly distributed according to their original Study Abroad Course Approval Form.  All credit earned abroad through the Study Abroad Office is considered UIC residential credit – not transfer credit.      © Copyright 2014-2020 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois     Footer Navigation                    Vice Provost for Global Engagement  Office of External Scholarships  Office of Financial Aid  University Registrar  Centers for Diversity  Disability Resources  Privacy Policy  Contact Us     Translate »  Cookie Settings
