Contents   Research assistance  Requesting books from the shelf  Designate someone to check out books for you  Scanning library materials  Using assistive technology  Printing  Quiet Areas  Distraction-free study  Accessible restrooms  Service dogs vs. therapy and emotional support animals  Emergency evacuation  Commitment   Research assistance  Make an appointment with a librarian to discuss your research assignments and identify relevant resources. One option is to meet online, sharing a screen to walk through the search process together. To work in person with a librarian and a sign language interpreter, please use this form to request an interpreter. It is recommended that you allow one week’s notice for this.  Other options to get help .  Requesting books from the shelf  Anyone may request that books be pulled for picked up at the front desk:   Locate the item of interest in the Library Catalog .  Click “Request Item.”  Log in.  Click “Check if item can be requested.”  Click “Request This Item.”  Select your “Pick Up Library” and “Pick Up Location.”  Click “Place Request.”  You’ll get an email when the book is ready to pick up (usually 1-2 days). As staffing permits, Library staff can also accompany students and employees who need assistance to the stacks in order to browse and retrieve books.   Designate someone to check out books for you  Patrons with disabilities can designate a proxy, another person who has authority to check out books for you using their own i-cards.  Assign a person to check out your materials .  Scanning library materials  Students in need of alternate format of inaccessible library materials must first register with the Disability Resource Center (DRC) , then fill out the Alternate Format Request Form . The DRC and the Library work collaboratively through this process to ensure students have equitable access to educational materials in a timely manner.  Faculty and staff who have requested and received an accommodation from the Office for Access and Equity (OAE) may place requests for materials by contacting their nearest ILL office using the relevant email address listed below.

Emergency evacuation  When elevators are not in service proceed to the designated Area of Rescue Assistance or nearest stairwell if you can and wait there to be evacuated by a member of the UIC Police Department (UICPD) or an emergency responder. If possible, ask a member of the library staff or another person to accompany you to the stairwell. Ask the person to immediately inform UICPD and/or other emergency responders of your exact location (floor, stairwell number, ect.) once the person has evacuated.  Once in the stairwell, call UICPD (312-355-5555) for help; if no help arrives in 5-10 minutes, call again.
