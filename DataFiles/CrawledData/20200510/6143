The students conducted a training program for about 300 home health care aides at the Chinese American Service League. They taught the aides body mechanics and safe functional transfer techniques to use in caring for elderly patients.  Faculty members Jenica Lee, occupational therapy, and Tanvi Bhatt, physical therapy, organized the group of nine PT and 10 OT students who conducted the training.  “It was a great collaboration and wonderful opportunity for both OT and PT students to apply their skills outside of the classroom, as well as to engage with the Chinese community,” says Lee. “And we’ve already been invited to do it again next year.”         Physical Therapy    Back to main content           Admissions and Programs    Expand Admissions and Programs menu          Doctor of Physical Therapy    Expand Doctor of Physical Therapy menu          What to Expect    Before You Apply    Applying    After You Apply    Accepted Applicants      MS in Healthspan Promotion and Rehabilitation    Expand MS in Healthspan Promotion and Rehabilitation menu          What to Expect    Before You Apply    Applying    After You Apply      Certificate in Clinical Rehabilitation and Technology Research    Expand Certificate in Clinical Rehabilitation and Technology Research menu          What to Expect      Healthy Living Practitioner™ Certificate    Expand Healthy Living Practitioner™ Certificate menu          What to Expect    Applying      Technology-Based Health Communication and Promotion Certificate    Expand Technology-Based Health Communication and Promotion Certificate menu          What to Expect    Applying      Residency in Orthopedic Physical Therapy    Expand Residency in Orthopedic Physical Therapy menu          Applying    Resident Accomplishments      Residency in Sports Physical Therapy    Expand Residency in Sports Physical Therapy menu          Applying    Resident Accomplishments        PT Faculty Practice    Continuing Education    News    Calendar    Directory    Contact              Follow Physical Therapy      Facebook                         College of  Applied Health  Sciences       UI Health Logo                            Quick Links    Calendar    Directory    News    Inside AHS    Graduation      Resources    Academic Support and Achievement Program    Student Resources    Faculty and Staff Resources    Academic Calendar      Tools    myUIC    GoogleApps@UIC    Webmail    Blackboard    Nessie        Connect with AHS    Contact us    Apply Now    Give to AHS         1919 W Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60612  312-996-6695  ahsinfo@uic.edu    Social Media Accounts      Facebook      Twitter      LinkedIn      Instagram      YouTube                     UIC.edu links   UIC.edu  Academic Calendar  Athletics  Campus Directory  Disability Resources  Emergency Information  Event Calendar  Job Openings  Library  Maps  UIC News  UI Health  Veterans Affairs        © 2020 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois |  Privacy Statement    Campuses   University of Illinois System  Urbana-Champaign  Springfield
