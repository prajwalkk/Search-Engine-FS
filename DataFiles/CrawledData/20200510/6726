Campus Labs is the leading platform and service provider for assessment in higher education providing specialized, comprehensive assessment tools that combines elements of data collection, reporting, organization, and integration to assess student experiences. The two platforms UIC Student Affairs utilizes are Baseline and Compliance Assist.  Baseline is an online, integrated and coordinated assessment platform for surveys, benchmark studies, rubrics, and student response tools. Within Baseline there are three components:   Online Surveys. Baseline assists in collecting data through online surveys and mobile survey devices. Basic analysis is automated in the reports feature using descriptive statistics (e.g. counts, percentages and means). If you want to administer an online survey, please contact Mark Manderino to discuss your plans.  Student Response System. The Student Response Tool is a formative assessment tool that will allow you to embed quick, direct measures of learning into workshops, trainings, and other learning experiences. With the Student Response System, you can create a short quiz or pulse survey that students respond to on their mobile device, tablet, or laptop. Results are viewable instantly, allowing you to get a climate reading on how well students are learning, their attitudes or opinions toward a topic, allowing you to make adjustments to the content or style of your workshop right away,and offer an engaging opening for conversation. To learn more about the Student Response System Tool access this How-To-Guide .  Rubrics are a qualitative evaluative tool that contain criteria and expectations, quality definitions for those criteria at particular levels of achievement over a continuum, and a scoring strategy. Rubrics can help communicate expectations and levels of performance for students, but primarily serve as a means to rate a student’s work or demonstration of a skill through a consistent and systematic way. The rubrics function in Baseline has both pre-formated rubrics from national projects and studies, as well as the ability for staff to create their own rubric. To learn more about the rubrics tool access this Campus Labs Rubrics Tutorial. Campus Labs Rubrics Tutorial .   Compliance Assist is our online planning and reporting platform that for annual reporting purposes. This tool is available for department’s to track and report on goals and key performance indicators related to their key programs and services.  To access these tools visit http://uic.campuslabs.com and use your UIC credentials. Permission to access either Baseline or Compliance Assist must be granted.  Please contact Mark Manderino for more information.
