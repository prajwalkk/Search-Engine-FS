The Pop-Up Pantry        Fifty percent come from households with annual incomes below $50,000, making them eligible for federal and state funds granted for financial need.  These conditions often force them to balance the need for basic necessities like food with the financial demands of tuition, fees, textbooks and school supplies.  The Pop-Up Pantry, which functions solely on donations from the UIC community, is a Wellness Center initiative that is committed to keeping students nourished, healthy, and academically engaged. Students in need can visit the Pop-Up Pantry monthly to shop the pantry’s shelves with dignity.  During the 2014-15 school year, we handed out 9,936 food items and 1,104 bags of groceries.      Support the Pop-Up Pantry and help talented and tenacious UIC students who, in the absence of hunger, can achieve tremendous academic and career success              The M. Christine Schwartz Experiential Learning Laboratory      Janet Lee felt nervous as she watched the baby’s breathing become labored and its complexion turn from white to blue. She knew, however, that the infant was not going to die.        The senior nursing student was treating a mannequin that closely resembled a child in the College of Nursing’s M. Christine Schwartz Experiential Learning Laboratory. After reading the baby’s vital signs from a computer printout, Lee and her classmate hurriedly began formulating a treatment plan to restore the baby’s health. Their quick reactions and knowledge helped the baby survive.
