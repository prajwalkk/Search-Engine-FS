offer a world-class oral health education continuously improved by innovation and led by expert faculty and staff - in the heart of the great city of Chicago  - but also because our student experience is so enriching.      One of the biggest reasons I chose UIC for dental school is because it’s so welcoming and supportive – it’s like a family.     Diversity    UIC is proud to be recognized as having one of the most ethnically and culturally rich college campuses in America.       Our welcoming environment and diverse student body engenders deeper learning and provides you with new perspectives on life. Diversity is fundamental to everything we do at the College of Dentistry. In declaring that diversity is a core value, we dedicate ourselves to building a culture of excellence that is grounded in principles of equity and social justice.

More about Diversity and the Urban Health Program     My favorite about being a student here is the diversity. I get to learn from people with so many different backgrounds, cultures and ways of life. It’s a very welcoming student experience.
