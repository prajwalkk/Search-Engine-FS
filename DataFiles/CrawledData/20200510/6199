Upon the successful completion of the program the participant is awarded a Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD) degree.          Application Requirements     How to Apply     Get Admissions Alerts              Program Description  In addition to a traditional 4-year DMD program, the UIC College of Dentistry offers an advanced standing program for foreign-trained dentists. The Doctor of Dental Medicine Advanced Standing (DMD-AS) is designed to provide foreign-trained dentists with the education and experience required to practice dentistry in the US. Beginning in January, the program consists of 30 months of coursework and clinical experience to deliver strong competencies in health promotion and disease prevention, diagnosis, evidence-based practice, communication, collaboration, and community engagement. Students will benefit from innovative Team-based (TBL) learning models and courses in Applied Oral and Behavioral Sciences, Oral-Systemic Issues, and Community Based Learning. Upon completion of the program students receive a Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD) degree and are eligible for licensure to practice dentistry in the United States of America.  Program Details  Length of program: 28 months  Starts in January  Class size: up to 52  Degree Awarded: Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD)  CODA Accredited  Application: ADEA CAAPID and UIC supplemental application  Case-Based Curriculum  The DMD features Team-based Learning (TBL) that integrates the clinical, biomedical, and behavioral sciences through the use of clinical case studies. These case scenarios place learning in the context of a patient problem/concern and emphasize the relationship between systemic and oral diseases, health and prevention, family and community context, disease diagnosis and evidence based practice.  A central feature of the DMD curriculum is the application of knowledge, skills and attitudes through Team discussions. In addition to acquiring content knowledge, the goals of TBL are:  to develop students’ capacity to find and apply information relevant to clinical cases,  to foster critical thinking and higher-order reasoning skills,  to promote accurate self-assessment and a sense of responsibility for one’s own learning, and  to build effective communication skills and, collaboration skills. To advance these goals, TBL sessions are skillfully facilitated to ensure that learning remain on target. Our trained faculty facilitators ensure that specified learning objectives are achieved and that the group dynamics are healthy and productive for all members of each team.
