The PCRPS was established to bring together interested faculty within the University of Illinois to pursue research and development projects collaboratively that are pertinent to the biomedical sciences in general and the pharmaceutical sciences in particular. The PCRPS involves a host of research, education, service, and outreach activities in the greater field of natural products,  medicinal plants, as well as dietary and food ingredients. Major PCRPS activities include the UIC Botanical Center, the NAPRALERT natural products database, pre- and postdoctoral training in natural products, the WHO Collaborative Centre (WHO TRMCC), the Atkins Medicinal Plant Garden, and the ICBG drug discovery program.  Research activities include drug discovery involving the isolation and biological evaluation of anticancer, cancer chemoprevention, antimalarial, anti-HIV, anti-TB, and other disease target agents from natural sources; studies in chemical carcinogenesis; collection of ethnomedical information in the field; biodiversity conservation based collection of medicinal plants for chemical and biological investigation; computerization of the world’s literature on the chemistry and biology of medicinal natural products; phytochemical analysis and standardization of natural products and herbal products; and the standardization, phytochemistry, biological activity evaluation, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and clinical studies of botanical dietary supplements for women’s health.  In addition to teaching and research, the faculty of the program are committed to the development of international programs, for example as members of the WHO Collaborating Centre on Traditional Medicine at UIC, as members of international pharmacopoeial boards, and through collaborative projects with colleagues worldwide.

Ethnomedical, pharmacological, and biochemical information on extracts of organisms from in vitro, in situ, in vivo, in humans (case reports, non-clinical trials) and clinical studies are included. In addition, similar information is available for metabolites from natural sources.
