clinicians devoted to the study of injury, wound healing, and regeneration. The members of this multidisciplinary research center investigate the body's reaction to injury, as well as mechanisms of repair and regeneration of tissues. The center's mission is to provide a comprehensive center that supports creative and innovative research in the area of wound healing and seeks to encourage interaction and collaboration between members of the academic and clinical communities who have an interest in understanding and advancing the treatment of wounds. Over 45 members are affiliated with the CWHTR, including research scientists and clinicians from across six colleges at UIC as well as faculty from UIUC and other Chicago area universities including Loyola, Rush, and Northwestern.    Luisa DiPietro, DDS, PhD, Center Director The Importance of Wound Healing Research     Current Areas of Research  Inflammatory Cell Recruitment in Acute Injury  Angiogenesis in Wound Repair  Effects of Stress on Wound Healing  Gender Differences Between Dermal and Mucosal Wounds  Impact of Aging, Ischemia and Cytokines on Wound Healing  Modulation of Scarring by Gene Therapy  The specific goals of the center are to promote collaborative research in the areas of tissue repair and regeneration, to support the research training of persons interested in the field,and to enhance translational research in injury and repair science. The long term goal of the scientists and clinicians in the CWHTR is to translate research findings into innovative therapeutic strategies to improve tissue repair and regeneration. To insure the future of healing and regeneration research, the Center maintains a strong commitment to the research training of pre-doctoral, post-doctoral, and clinical trainees.  The Center is currently supported by individual investigator grants (NIH, DOD, industry, foundation), and was recognized as one of four national Centers for Innovative Wound Healing in September, 2006.   The CWHTR is under the direction of Dr. Luisa DiPietro, DDS, PhD.  The CWHTR is located at the University of Illinois Chicago campus, within the College of Dentistry. Due to location within the College of Dentistry, and close proximity to the College of Medicine, basic science departments and the Illinois Medical District, the Center has an opportunity to facilitate interdisciplinary partnerships between numerous clinical and academic departments. The CWHTR also includes research and clinical partners affiliated with other major medical/research facilities in the greater Chicago area.      Programs       The CWHTR offers research and training opportunities for graduate students and professional students, post-doctoral fellows, undergraduate students, and visiting scholars. The center also hosts a monthly Wound Healing Research Journal Club and Regenerative Sciences Seminar Series, as well as a biennial Regenerative Science Research Symposium.    Regenerative Sciences Seminar Series  Join us for a series of informative seminars exploring a variety of topics in Regenerative Science. Speakers will present the latest research and trends in basic and translational regenerative sciences, from the repair of damaged and diseased tissue to the growth of cells/tissues to replace lost tissues, as well as the study of how materials interact with living tissues and the building of tissue replacements. RS3 is held from 12:30 - 1:30 on the 2nd Thursday of the month from Oct - May. Seminars are open to staff, faculty, and students.   Dates for the 2019-2020 RS3 Series:  October 10, 2019  November 14, 2019  January 9, 2020  February 13, 2020  March 12, 2020  April  9, 2020  May 28, 2020    Wound Healing Journal Club  The Wound Healing Journal Club meets on the 3rd Wednesday of each month from 12:30-2:00 at the Center for Wound Healing and Tissue Regeneration in the UIC College of Dentistry. The club uses a survey format, and members are each assigned 2-3 articles chosen from a PubMed search of “Wound Healing” for the previous month. Presentations are short summaries of the papers, highlighting their contributions to the field. The Journal Club provides a way to stay abreast of recent publications in all aspects of wound healing research.
