Faculty and staff play a crucial role in the DRC process by making appropriate referrals and connecting students with the DRC. Below are some "Dos and Don'ts" for making appropriate referrals, as well as materials to incorporate into your practices.  DOs   Make a general announcement about the DRC to normalize service during Orientation or the first week of class  Emphasize the importance of seeking help if you need it  Refer students who disclose disability status to the DRC (they can call, email, or stop by)  Respect confidentiality – even if the student seems to be open to public conversation  Use questions that open the door for student disclosure, such as:  Has this kind of assignment always been difficult for you?  I noticed you ran out of time -- does that happen a lot?  Have there been any supports or resources in the past that were particularly helpful for you?  It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now. Are you talking to anyone about it?     DON’Ts   Make assumptions about disability status  Ask for or collect medical documentation  Make up accommodations with students outside DRC process  Make judgmental comments:  “Are you sure you want to pursue such a difficult career path?”  “You don’t look disabled.”    Praise or valorize students for not making use of an disability accommodation   Materials (click the following links to download)  DRC Syllabus Statement and Announcement (incorporate this statement into your course syllabus, and use this announcement as a guide for the first week of class)  DRC PowerPoint Slide (to include in first week presentations)  DRC Flier (for use at any point in Orientations or for referrals)                     UIC Logo        Disability Resource Center       Contact   1200 W.
