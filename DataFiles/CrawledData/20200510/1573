She has nearly 20 years of experience in communications, strategy, and marketing, mostly focused in higher and secondary education. Before coming to UIC, Nicole led long-range and short-term strategic planning at the Gabelli School of Business at Fordham University, where she also managed communications and marketing. Her expertise is in devising and implementing communications infrastructure for educational institutions: assessing needs, determining an organizational structure to meet those needs, and developing teams of talented staff members. She is fortunate to have worked for forward-thinking deans and to have had smart, creative, and dedicated colleagues.  Nicole holds a PhD in communication from Rutgers University, a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University, and a bachelor's degree in English and psychology from Georgetown University. She enjoys urban exploration, international travel, manual-transmission European cars, and milk chocolate chips.     Selected Publications   Gesualdo, N., Weber, M. S., & Yanovitzky, I.
