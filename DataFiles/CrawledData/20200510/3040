Graduate College Faculty Offline (Excel Spreadsheet)    Graduate Faculty Online         Membership Categories   Membership Categories  Membership categories of Graduate College Faculty allow different rights and privileges pertaining to student mentoring and serving on student committees.  The following is excerpted from the Bylaws of the Graduate College.    Graduate College Bylaws         Full Membership   Full Membership  Full Membership is granted for the term of employment to tenured or tenure track faculty in a UIC department that houses a program under the umbrella of the Graduate College who have been recommended by the department or other teaching or research divisions and approved by the Dean. In the College of Medicine recommendations for full membership are limited to appointments in the Research Track.  Retired faculty with Full membership automatically retain their memberships at the same level for three years after retirement. In special cases membership can be extended upon request to the Graduate Dean by the Executive Officer attesting to the fact that the nominated faculty is still active in graduate education.       Associate Membership   Associate Membership  Associate members are typically clinical track or non-tenure system faculty whose program wishes to grant them the right to serve as primary advisors to students in that program. Once appointed, Associate members retain their memberships so long as they continue to meet the criteria. Associate Membership is granted upon recommendation to the Dean by the Executive Officer of the department or equivalent unit. The nominating department must take a vote of the Full members of the Graduate Faculty on the question of the candidate’s membership. The results of that vote must accompany the membership request. In exceptional circumstances, distinguished individuals without a UIC appointment may be proposed for Associate membership and approved for a fixed term.  Retired faculty with Associate membership automatically retain their memberships at the same level for three years after retirement. In special cases membership can be extended upon request to the Graduate Dean by the Executive Officer attesting to the fact that the nominated faculty is still active in graduate education.       Adjunct Membership   Adjunct Membership  Adjunct members are typically UIC faculty or other employees who possess expertise that makes it likely and desirable for them to serve repeatedly on graduate student committees. Adjunct members must be UIC employees. They are appointed for three-year (renewable) terms through a recommendation to the Graduate Dean from the Executive Officer of the department or equivalent unit.       Courtesy Membership   Courtesy Membership  Courtesy members are typically non-UIC employees who possess some expertise that makes them desirable members of a particular graduate student committee. Courtesy members are appointed to sit on a specific committee, and need to be reappointed for each committee. Courtesy members are appointed through a recommendation to the Graduate Dean from the Executive Officer of the department or equivalent unit.       Graduate College Faculty Membership Nominations   Graduate College Faculty Membership Nominations  Graduate Faculty do not nominate themselves for membership. The Nomination Form for Graduate College Faculty Membership must be submitted from the Executive Officer’s (typically head or chair) office, of an academic department or equivalent unit that holds a graduate degree program.
