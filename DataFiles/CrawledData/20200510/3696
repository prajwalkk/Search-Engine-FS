What is iBuy? – Think of iBuy as a payment method, just like a credit card.  Why are there vendor website links in iBuy? – Website links you see on the homepage are called ‘PunchOut’ websites, which are dedicated websites created by the vendor for iBuy, with discounted prices already showing.  Why do some vendors have websites in iBuy and others don’t? – The few vendors that have PunchOuts have university contracts with discounts.  How do I search for products in iBuy? – If a vendor has a PunchOut, go to it and search for your product. If they do not, go directly to the vendor website, find the product, then use non-catalog instructions above to make the purchase.  For example, McMaster.com is a vendor available in iBuy, but they do not have a PunchOut. Go to their website, copy/paste description/catalog#/price into iBuy, and submit your requisition.
