It also brings a lot of responsibility. The people living in your community could be fellow students or families who have lived there for a number of years. It’s important to be respectful to your neighbors living in your community. UIC strongly encourages students to build good relationships with their surrounding community. We expect students to uphold the Student Disciplinary Policy while living in their off campus apartments as well as any federal, local or state laws and ordinances to create a safe and peaceful community.  Helpful tips on being a good neighbor:   Introduce yourself to your neighbors when you move in and learn their names  Exchange phone numbers with your neighbor and encourage them to contact you if a problem arises. Be respectful and responsive to their concerns.  Be friendly. Say hello or wave to your neighbor when you see them.  Take part in community gatherings and events such as block parties, etc.   Pets  All pets should be enclosed in your own yard. Pet owners should make sure to pick up after their pets. Be mindful of your pet’s noises, such as barking, as not to disrupt your neighbors.  Parking  Residents should abide to all parking ordinances as well as making sure their guests abide as well. Make sure you are parking in your own assigned spot, if assigned and you are not blocking any of your neighbor’s driveways.  Property Appearance  Make sure you are disposing of your trash properly and in the appropriate bins. Your yard should be kept clean and maintained. If it is your landlord’s responsibility to maintain your yard, make sure your landlord is aware and getting it done.  Social Gatherings  It is natural for a student to want to invite friends over and host a social gathering. It is when more and more un-invited guests are showing up which can lead to a disturbance. Here are some helpful tips to keep in mind when hosting a social gathering:   Inform your neighbors that you will be hosting a social event in your residence. Encourage them to reach out to you if the noise level gets too high or any other issue occurs.  Be mindful of the noise you are causing. If you can hear noise coming from outside of your residence, so can your neighbors and it is too loud.  Establish a reasonable time for your gathering to end. Remember that not everyone is on the same schedule as you and your neighbors may have jobs or families to tend to in the morning.  Inform guests to remain on your property and not on your neighbor’s property.  Make sure your guests are disposing of their trash appropriately. Provide the correct and necessary amount of trash bins.  Keep in mind you are responsible for your guests’ actions and behaviors as well as your own.   Your Role as a UIC Student in the Community  As a member of the UIC community, you are expected to act in accordance with the policies, rules, regulations, laws, and requirements of UIC, local municipalities and counties, the State of Illinois, and the United States. You should be aware that you are responsible not only for the intent behind your behavior, but also for the impact of your actions.  Expectations for student behavior, both on and off campus, are outlined in the Student Disciplinary Policy. We recommend that you take a moment to review the policy at Student Disciplinary Policy . This policy also outlines the student conduct process and procedures in the event you are alleged of a violation of the Standards of Conduct in the future.
