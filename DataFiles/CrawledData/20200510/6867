The College offers degrees in nine fields of engineering in six different departments and over 20,000 students have received a degree from the College and gone on to become leaders in their industries and top researchers around the world.  The UIC College of Engineering and the Programs for International Partnerships (PIP) office work together closely to offer the 3+2 Engineering program to students from partner universities and organizations, which includes a non-degree, two-semester undergraduate program, as well as Master of Science degrees in a number of engineering disciplines.       Points        69 th   in the country according to the US News & World Report 2020 Best Graduate Schools Rankings         $90.4Mil   for research and development grants, spanning six departments and more than 150 projects         100 +   faculty run laboratories and several interdisciplinary college-wide research centers provide excellent research opportunities           First Year: Non-Degree Training Program        This program is designed for students pursuing Engineering-related undergraduate degrees in their home universities. Participants in this program will complete their final (senior) year of undergraduate study at UIC taking courses in related fields. During their first year at UIC, students participate in a 9-month (two semesters) non-degree undergraduate program designed to allow them to take six courses in fields of study corresponding to their home university’s final (senior) curricula, including two undergraduate senior design and thesis courses as required by the home universities. At the end of the first-year program, students are awarded UIC academic credits and are issued official UIC transcripts.  Potential participants are selected by their home university based on their academic performance and professional goals. UIC faculty/staff will interview the students in their home country to evaluate their English language ability and to see if they would be successful in an American classroom.  A TOEFL/IELTS score is not required for admission.          Second Year: MS Programs in Engineering        Students who have successfully completed the first-year, non-degree program can apply for entry into the Masters of Science program.  Through this program, the UIC College of Engineering, working with the Programs for International Partnerships office, offers a number of  Master of Science Degrees in the fields of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) , Chemical Engineering (ChE) , Mechanical Engineering (ME), Industrial Engineering (IE) , Civil Engineering (CE) and Bioengineering (BioE) . Participants in the programs take classes with regular UIC Engineering students. Courses are taught by UIC Faculty and all degrees are accredited by official U.S. accreditation organizations for those majors.  Students who have successfully completed the first year’s non-degree training program can apply for the Master of Science Program and will be evaluated on their respective admission qualifications. TOEFL/IELTS score is required for admission.
