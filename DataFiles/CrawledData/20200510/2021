DEPTH         i                     Due to the COVID-19 pandemic UIC continues to accept undergraduate first-year and transfer applications for the Fall 2020 semester.            Before you apply    It's never too early to start planning.  Early preparation is the key to a smooth application and admission process.  Do your research.  You probably already know which program you intend to apply for, but we encourage you to take some time to look through the program’s website. Look into the college's achievements, their research, and any other resources they provide prospective students. Note the key contacts, such as the program coordinator, and contact information for your intended program.  Keep track of all deadlines that apply to you.  Don’t wait until the last minute to apply!  Many programs have earlier deadlines , such as for PhD applications.  In many cases materials may still be accepted after published application deadlines, but some programs have strict materials submission deadlines. Refer to the program's website to see if they have published materials submission deadlines.  Check your requirements.  Familiarize yourself with the Admissions requirements (application fee or waiver, academic credentials, English proficiency requirements).  And refer to the program’s website for Program-specific requirements (which may include items such as the GRE test, Personal Statements, Letters of Recommendation, etc.).  Prepare your documents for online submission.  The general graduate application process is paperless . Please do not mail any materials or credentials to the university unless expressly notified to do so. Our office will request official credentials from admitted students only. Hard-copy application materials received by our office will be discarded.   For Spring 2018 and Summer 2018 applications, documents that you will upload must be in PDF format, no larger than 5 MB in size.  For Fall 2018+ applications, documents may be in PDF or Word (.doc, .docx.) format.  "Portfolio" PDFs and secured PDFs which require a password to open are not compatible with our system.  Refer to the credential requirements for Domestic and International applicants for notes on acceptable transcripts and other necessary documentation.  Have your official test scores sent in advance.  Our ETS Institutional Code for TOEFL and GRE is 1851.  Think about funding.  See what funding options are available to you. The Graduate College has compiled a wide range of great information about funding opportunities and financial resources on their website . Your intended program's website may also provide a list of funding opportunities specific to the program. Here are a few:  College of Education  Social Work - MSW         Applying & Submitting Requirements    Ready to apply? Complete these steps.  Some programs have special application procedures or supplemental applications.  The Apply page will direct you to the program's website when there's a special application process in place for the program outside of the general graduate process.  Complete and submit the application .  Within the application you will be required to submit academic credentials as applicable for your applicant type .  You will also be prompted to submit any materials required by the program (which could include personal statements, writing samples, etc.) and initiate online requests for letters of recommendation (if required).  After submitting the application itself, submit the application fee.  Applications with a fee due will remain in an incomplete status. If an application fee waiver was selected, Admissions will verify that the waiver applies.         Application Review Period    You've already applied and submitted requested materials. What's next? How are applications reviewed?  Check your application status regularly.  You can check your status online. This is where you’ll find your checklist noting items that have been received and those that are still being requested.  Additional items may be added to your checklist if received items are incorrect or additional documentation is needed. Note that applications will switch from a complete to incomplete status if submitted documents are found to be insufficient and additional items are added.  Departmental Review  After all Admissions requirements are satisfied, application records are referred to the program for their review, though programs may have already begun their review by that time. Admissions and program staff are able to access application materials after they are submitted. They are typically reviewed in the order they are received.  The time that it takes for an application to go through the review process varies by program. After the program has completed their review of an application, they communicate the admission recommendations and denials to Admissions and we update the official record after a final quick review. Some programs communicate their decisions to Admissions continually throughout the cycle while others do so in bursts. Ultimately, it depends on the timeline and approach each program takes for their review.  Graduate College Review  In certain cases where minimum requirements are not met or additional approval is needed, applications recommended for admission by Graduate College programs may need to undergo an additional review by the Graduate College. The Graduate College may decide to uphold the program's admission recommendation or, in certain cases, deny the application.  This would not apply to professional level programs and graduate level programs that do not fall under the Graduate College.         After a Decision has been Made    What should you do next?  Once a final decision is entered by the Office of Admissions, the application portal will be updated to note the decision and an official decision letter will be mailed out.  If you've been admitted...  Congratulations! Access our Admitted Student page to follow up with next steps, including submission of official credentials, if needed.  International students who will need a student visa should submit OIS-requested documents for the Office of International Services.  If you need to defer admission…  Admission can be deferred once for up to one academic year (e.g., Fall admission can be deferred to the following Spring, Summer, or Fall terms).  Start by notifying the program that you’d like to defer admission. They must first approve deferrals. Program-approved deferrals are then forwarded to us for final approval and official updates to the student record.  If you’ve been denied…  Our office unfortunately does not often know the exact reasons why a program may have denied an applicant.  You may contact the program directly to inquire about the decision they made. In some cases, programs may be able to advise you on what you can do to improve your applicant profile or successfully apply for a future term.                       Already applied?
