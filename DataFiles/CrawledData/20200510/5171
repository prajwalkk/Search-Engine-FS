Application deadline schedule       Check your requirements   Freshmen  You’re considered a freshman if you’re applying while you’re still in high school or you’ve graduated from high school but haven’t attended college yet. You must meet the general UIC entrance requirements .  Transfer students  You’re considered a transfer student if you’ve earned 24 semester hours (36 quarter hours) or more at another college. You must have:   Minimum GPA of 2.5 (on a 4.0 scale)  No more than 60 semester hours (90 quarter hours) from a two-year college or university  UIC transfer requirements   International students only: If English isn’t your native language, you might need to take a minimum English proficiency test. Check out the International Requirements to see if this applies to you.      Prepare your documents   When you apply, you’ll need to submit your transcripts and two essays. If you’re applying to the Honors College or GPPA, you’ll also need two letters of recommendation. Get started on those now! Refer to the UIC Application Tips page for all the specifics.  Your application essays and recommendations are an opportunity to make your application stand out. Start early so you have enough time to meet deadlines.  International Students: You might have a few extra things you need to provide. Read through the International Requirements page to make sure you have everything you need.   Have your test scores sent in advance  ACT/SAT scores are required for all applicants. Scores can be sent electronically from the testing service or as part of your high school transcript. Student copies and other unofficial score reports are considered self-reported.  International Students: If English isn’t your native language, you might need to take the TOEFL. Check out the International Requirements to see if this applies to you.     Find out more about the TOEFL on the ETS site       Think about funding   UIC has financial aid support for you no matter what type of student you are—first-year, transfer or continuing. Last year, nearly two-thirds of all UIC students received grants or scholarships.  Even before you apply, you can fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and include UIC’s school code: 001776. This is the first step in the financial aid process for most every student. A lot of scholarships and grants have deadlines earlier than the admission deadline. Get a head start and make sure you don’t miss out on an opportunity.
