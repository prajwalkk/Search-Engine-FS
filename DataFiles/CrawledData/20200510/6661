Student Affairs has developed five strategic priorities that chart the direction of our work with students. The priorities are as follows:   Student-Centered Culture  Welcoming and Modern Environments  Synergy with Chicago  Organizational Effectiveness/Organizational Innovation  Enterprising Strength and Resources       1. Student-Centered Culture    Foster a student-centered culture that serves as a cornerstone for the work of Student Affairs        2. Welcoming and Modern Environments   A “students first” culture will drive Student Affairs to ignite students’ passion by enriching their academic, personal, and professional goals. Inherit is our responsibility to support and advocate for diverse students, create engagement experiences, provide mechanisms for studentlearning/feedback, and support students in distress. In this process we foster a sense of belonging, career/professional astuteness, interest in lifelong learning, community service, and the application of tools to care for themselves and others.  Cultivate Student Support & Advocacy   Continue to support and advocate for students by cultivating awareness and providing direct assistance in areas that include mental health, safety, interpersonal relationships and home/food insecurities;  Strive to regularly connect with students to gain insight and feedback about theirstudent experience to more effectively assess and respond to their needs, and ultimately ensure a positive experience and success is achieved at UIC;  Strengthen mechanisms to encourage student input and assessment as a consistent component of services and program planning;  Develop a culture of care in a safe and nurturing environment where students will develop positive identities and experience a strong sense of belonging.   Develop Community through Diversity, Inclusiveness, Equity, & Social Justice   Enhance our capacity to become more responsive to diverse students’ needs by extending beyond our customary reach;  Identify gaps and serve as a resource for students and staff on diversity/inclusion matters;  Generate opportunities to create dialogue and hear all students’ voices based on dignity and respect.   Enhance Student Engagement through Programs & Services   Increase collaborative and intentional programs by aligning efforts within the division;  Create consistent delivery of integrated services through purposeful organizational transparency;  Deliver the premiere urban university experience that includes limitless engagement opportunities to connect both with on- and off-campus community partners, and alumni;  Address the changing needs of students by expanding and optimizing service levels and opportunities for students to engage with Student Affairs programs and services.   Foster Student Learning   Establish, measure, and refine our programs and services using a student learning paradigm  Model evidence based strategies to enhance and improve students’ co-curricularlearning opportunities;  Adopt innovative strategies to enhance student academic learning support;  Guide students in identifying barriers to their own success while encouraging a self-directed solutions-based approach.       2. Welcoming and Modern Environments    Enhance welcoming and modern environments that build community        Facilities   State of the art facilities should be an essential part of the UIC experience. UIC Student Affairs prides itself in providing, creating, and maintaining multifunctional, safe and inclusive spaces. Thus providing students an opportunity to meet a diverse student body, engage in high engagement activities, and support their overall student experience to build community. To achieve the UIC strategic priorities and be globally competitive, we must focus our efforts in upgrading and maintaining our facilities to the highest standards.  Create Inviting, Safe and Inclusive Spaces   Ensure accessibility to spaces for all students;  Reinforce student friendly, comfortable, and welcoming spaces via aesthetic and clear signage;  Modernize offices and gathering spaces to emphasize UIC Pride;  Review current policies and practices affecting spaces that reduce opportunities for campus engagement.

Synergy with Chicago    Create synergy with the city to foster mutually beneficial relationships between our students and Chicago        Student Affairs   UIC Student Affairs is well positioned to be a bridge between the University, the City and itsresidents, including alumni, by embracing our relationship and commitment to Chicago. We have an opportunity to model the relationship the University can have with the City through our programs on- and offcampus, in our facilities, as well as through partnerships created to support our students and surrounding community. We must further create intentional opportunities for students to learn bydoing and develop into socially responsible active citizens by getting involved with neighborhood communities and the City.
