The club uses a survey format, and members are each assigned 2-3 articles chosen from a PubMed search of “Wound Healing” for the previous month. Presentations are short summaries of the papers, highlighting their contributions to the field. The Journal Club provides a way to stay abreast of recent publications in all aspects of wound healing research.  For more information about the Wound Healing Journal Club, please contact Dr. Luisa DiPietro .   Dates & Times RS3 is typically held from 12:30 – 1:30 on the 2 nd Thursday of the month from Oct - May. Wound Healing Journal Club meets on the 3rd Wednesday of each month from 12:30-2:00.

Craniofacial Pathobiology  Working to improve treatment of oral cancer, caries, peridontal and other oral diseases. We are leading interdisciplinary investigations in the development and function of the craniofacial complex to better understand processes that occur within cells and tissues to maintain health and control growth and development.      Regenerative Science  Moving beyond tissue replacement, using materials to enable our bodies to regenerate damaged and failing tissues. We are leading investigations into how materials interact with living tissues, and the building of tissue replacements for the growth of cells/tissues to replace lost tissues. The Center for Wound Healing and Tissue Regeneration (CWHTR) is a unique community of scientists and clinicians devoted to the study of injury, wound healing, and regeneration. The Laboratory of Applied Dental Biomaterials and Interfaces is a NIH funded center studying the properties of the tooth in order to develop reparative/regenerative biomaterials to replace lost tooth structure.      Clinical, Translational & Community  Leading transformative studies to improve oral health outcomes both in the clinic and the community. We have several centers and investigators focused on the study of the incidence and prevalence of disease; measuring outcomes of interventions; and safety and efficacy of drugs, devices, and treatments in individuals. We are also investigating how and why efforts to promote oral health through intervention are accepted by communities. The Oral Medicine and Pharmacognosy Research (OMPR) Laboratory focuses on medical anthropology and ethnopharmacology to study the non-destructive radiation in oral diagnostics and forensics. The Dental Medicine Responder Training (DMRT) is performing theory and policy research supporting dental professionals for emergency preparedness throughout the community.
