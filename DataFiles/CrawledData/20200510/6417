Admission: Fall only  This Advanced Generalist Master of Science (AGMS) program provides professional nurses with the clinical leadership skills needed to improve patient outcomes by integrating evidence-based practice and care coordination in a fiscally responsible manner. Not limited to acute care settings, advanced generalists evaluate client outcomes, assess client risks, and promote client and family advocacy. They are able to synthesize knowledge from nursing and related disciplines, to improve healthcare by assuming leadership roles, and to contribute to the advancement of the profession.

Most students complete the 34-credit-hour degree in one to two years.  Applicants with a bachelor’s degree in nursing move directly through the program; applicants with a non-nursing bachelor’s degree and an RN license enter the AGMS Transition Program , where they take up to four additional courses.  All students complete the same sequence of courses, including online, on-site and blended courses. Along with lectures and hands-on training in a lab setting, students participate in clinical experiences in a wide range of focus areas and care settings. Faculty assign all students to clinical practicum sites; students are not responsible for finding their own.
