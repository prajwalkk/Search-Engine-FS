The goals of the department are leadership, innovation, initiative, and quality with strong focus on the unique arena of health informatics at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  The department actively supports the central mission of the College of Applied Health Sciences by facilitating innovative educational and research programs, providing leadership within department disciplines to meet current industry challenges, and ensuring that graduates have a competitive edge in the increasingly demanding health informatics marketplace. The department strives to produce healthcare professionals who can effectively partner with and/or lead information technology professionals in the problem-solving activities of their organizations.  The Department of Biomedical and Health Information Sciences offers an undergraduate program leading to the Bachelor of Science in Health Information Management. More information is available on the department's website .  Accreditation  The Bachelor of Science in Health Information Management program is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education (CAHIIM).  BS in Health Information Management  The Health Information Management undergraduate degree program provides skilled instruction in the management and use of information and information systems for healthcare planning, provision, resource allocation, and executive decision making. The undergraduate program, established in 1965, maintains a reputation of excellence and consistently produces graduates who become leaders in the field.  Within the world of health information management, registered health information administrators (RHIAs) are responsible for the management of health information systems consistent with the medical, administrative, ethical, and legal requirements of the healthcare delivery system. RHIAs often have opportunities to develop information systems for quality patient care, facility reimbursement, medical research, health planning, and healthcare evaluation. Administrative duties of the RHIA encompass responsibility for personnel, capital equipment selection, systems design and analysis, hospital committee activities, and budget management. RHIAs also analyze data, develop presentations, provide health information to qualified users, and safeguard confidential patient data. The job forecast for RHIAs is positive, not only in hospitals but also in other healthcare settings, such as home health agencies, hospice programs, nursing homes, and ambulatory care facilities. Employment opportunities also exist in education, research, consulting, sales, insurance companies, and with state and national healthcare organizations.  The Health Information Management program is available on a full- or part-time basis, campus-based, or online. Admissions to the campus-based program are accepted for the fall semester only. Admissions to the online program are accepted each semester. Although health information technician course credits do not count toward the required 60 semester or 90 quarter hours of prerequisites, students who are graduates of an associate degree program in health information technology accredited by the Commission on Health Informatics and Information Management Education (CAHIIM), who also hold current Registered Health Information Technician (RHIT) and/or coding certification may receive up to 31 hours of proficiency credit in required Health Information Management courses. Other students with a transcript of equivalent coursework may request the opportunity to demonstrate proficiency through exam.  Graduates receive a Bachelor of Science in Health Information Management degree and are eligible to register for the national RHIA credential examination offered by AHIMA.  Note : Due to the evolving nature of this profession, all courses in the major must be completed within three years of program enrollment. If the student goes beyond this time frame, due to leave of absence, single semester time off, repeating courses, or other reasons, the student may be required to demonstrate proficiency by exam or retake the course at an established minimum grade to continue in the program. A student may be dismissed from the program if the student demonstrates a pattern of poor academic progress and has failed to demonstrate competence at the established minimum level.  Transfer Admission Requirements  Students seeking admission to the Bachelor of Science in Health Information Management program must meet these minimum requirements:   Completion of application process, including a personal interview and submission of three references.  Demonstrated reading and writing proficiency; ability to convey maturity; desire to work with people; and ability to direct work of others.  Thorough understanding of the professional health information manager’s role and responsibilities.  Junior standing with 60 transferable semester or 90 transferable quarter credit hours at an accredited college/university.  Successful completion of Pre-Health Information Management courses offered by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences or the equivalent.  Cumulative grade point average of 2.50/4.00 for all transferable undergraduate courses.   See the Office of Admission Transfer Guide for more information about transfer admission requirements.
