The ACCC uses RT for request tracking and offers RT instances to other campus units for any type of email or request tracking that needs to be handled by a group of people.  RT is a product of Best Practical. Best Practical has a list of RT features and an RT Wiki that explains the details of normal use.

The Principal Administrator of each RT instance must have a UIC NetID and ACCC common password, and, in general, so will all the other people in the department or unit who will be handling the tickets in the RT instance. These are the RT instance “users”; the people who will answer the tickets/requests.  From the requestor’s point of view: Anyone can send email to RT or receive email from RT, regardless of what their email address is and regardless of whether they have a UIC account. So its use as a ticket handling system via email is not limited in any way by the location or privileges of the person asking the question — the “requestor.”  Also, anyone with a UIC NetID and ACCC common password can log into the RT Web site and manage all the tickets they are associated with, either as a requestor, an interested party, or as a person responding to the ticket.  Each RT Instance must have at least one Principal Administrator, who will have superuser privileges allowing them to configure that RT instance. The principal administrator: adds the instance’s “users,” creates the instance’s queues, assigns privileges, and can create new superusers.
