Types of Advising Appointments     What is an Individual Career Advising Appointment?         individual   UIC students are able to meet one-on-one with a career advisor for help with career-related tasks.  Things to know about individual career advising appointments:   Our career advisors are trained professionals with expertise in career advising and coaching.  Appointments may vary in length, depending on student needs, from 30-50 minutes.  The appointments generally occur in our office, but can also occur over the phone or by video conference ( WebEx ).     Career Advisors can assist UIC students in the following ways:   Assess interests, values, and strengths and how these factors connect to majors/careers.  Develop internship or job search strategies to help students target appropriate employers.  Create or edit career-related documents such as resumes and cover letters.  Prepare for upcoming interviews and brainstorm interview questions/scenarios.    Career Advisors cannot:   Tell students what career (or major) is/is not a good fit for them.  Find internships or jobs for students.  Change a major or minor for a student, this is part of the role of an academic advisor.
