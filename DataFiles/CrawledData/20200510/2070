About half of Honors first-year students and a third of all Honors Students live in campus residence halls, with over 325 in Honors Housing. Activities include informal events with faculty, study groups, and social events. Honors students involved in this community often find themselves collaborating on class assignments/projects, but also going out into the Chicago community to do service-related activities as well as various Honors College-related events.  Students in Honors Housing have access to support from student peer mentors and resident assistants who are Honors College students, who plan programs and events to connect students and provide enrichment opportunities as well as informal guidance and support.  When filling out the Housing application you can express your interest in Honors Housing.
