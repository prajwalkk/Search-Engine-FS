Program Overview      The CMBA Programs truly offers a world-class education in a world-class city. We welcome your interest and look forward to receiving your application.  CMBA Programs are one year full-time degree programs. Students enter the program with a group (called a cohort). All students in a given cohort take the same courses at the same time throughout the program. The academic plan for each cohort is constructed by the CMBA Office.  Each cohort follows one of four academic tracks:  Strategic and International Business Management (SIM), Financial Markets and Asset Management (FMAM), Healthcare Management (HM) or Commodities, Exchanges and Derivatives (CED).  The relatively shorter time frame of this program is achieved by making the program somewhat more intensive than the traditional full-time MBA programs and by reducing the amount of breaks between semesters.  The SIM, FMAM, HM and CED focuses are tracked and scheduled independent of the university calendar to allow students to complete the program within 12 calendar months. Each start date has its own academic focus.       Areas of Focus     Strategic and International Business Management   The MBA program with a focus in Strategic and International Business Management seeks to foster an understanding of international business practices and culture together with knowledge of the core functional areas of business and to allow students to develop their judgment and ability in applying this knowledge in a global business environment.

CMBA vs. MBA   All students earning an MBA degree from UIC must meet the same academic requirements and receive the same diploma irrespective of the program format.  However, traditional campus MBA programs are typically designed for students to study full time over a two-year period or part time over an extended period while still employed. Students individually choose their courses to meet the degree requirements, including an advanced area of study.  In contrast, our students go through the program together as a cohort— allowing the entire degree program to be tailored to the needs of the group, including sequence, delivery and selection of advanced courses or the development of special topic courses. To accomplish program goals, the CMBA Programs Office, working with the sponsoring organization, may modify instructional schedules and the selection of advanced courses after the program begins.        How are the programs structured?         Program Structure   All of the university’s MBA Programs require a minimum of 54 semester hours of credit in approved course work, including the successful completion of all core courses.  Courses for the CMBA Programs are scheduled in a number of modules varying in length over the 12-month period. There is one major vacation break at the end of December.  Course work in the CMBA Programs is scheduled to allow students to complete program requirements in 12 months. The program area of focus is tailored to the needs of the particular cohort.  For custom programs designed for Chicago-area corporations,  programs are custom delivered according to participating employees’ needs and schedule. This practice extends value to part-time MBA students who need a time-efficient program to balance work, study and family obligations. The concentration or area of focus is chosen in collaboration with your corporate leaders based upon strategic company objectives.        How do I apply?         Applying   Students apply through a sponsoring organization or corporation working in partnership with UIC. Individual applicants should contact cmba@uic.edu        What areas of focus do you offer in the CMBA Programs?         Areas of Focus   We currently offer areas of focus in Strategic and International Business Management, Financial Markets and Asset Management, Healthcare Management, and Commodities, Exchanges and Derivatives.  Other areas of focus are offered and new areas may be developed based on expressions of interest from sponsoring organizations. The college has areas of particular strength in strategy, finance, accounting and entrepreneurship. Please contact our office directly for more information.  The CMBA Programs are based in a major public urban research university, which allows these programs to draw on the breadth and depth of faculty in the College of Business Administration and on the broader expertise and resources of the university. The programs additionally utilize the resources of the city of Chicago and the metropolitan area.        How is it possible to complete the degree program in 12 months?         12-Month Completion            The relatively shorter timeframe for the CMBA Programs is achieved by making the program somewhat more intensive than traditional full-time MBA programs and by greatly reducing the amount of vacation time. Instead of four terms of study spread over 16 to 21 months in a typical 2-year program, our programs require a slightly more demanding course load: all degree requirements are completed in approximately 49 weeks of study within the 12 months of the program.
