The program will provide up to 20 hours with an experienced SBIR/STTR grant consultant.  The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs are designed to help small businesses turn innovative ideas into market-worthy products. UIC faculty members interested in starting a company can use SBIR and STTR grants to bridge the gap between basic science and commercialization. Faculty can receive up to $150,000 for a Phase I award and up to $1,000,000 for a Phase II award to advance their research through these federal funding mechanisms.
