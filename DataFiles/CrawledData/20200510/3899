He is currently employed as a civil engineer for Mackie Consultants, in Rosemont, IL, which is part of The Burke Group (TBG). The core of David's work is in water resources engineering—a passion of his—as it relates to sustainability and resource management. A number of the projects David works on involve stormwater management and green infrastructure. Along with his work as a civil engineer, David also serves on the TBG Sustainability Committee and is Vice President of Education for the TBG Toastmasters group, one of many international clubs promoting leadership and public speaking skills. Outside of his work, David maintains a strong relationship with UIC and is always looking for ways to give back. He mentored graduating UIC civil engineering students on their capstone projects, judged at the UIC Engineering EXPO, assisted at UIC Open Houses, and currently conducts research as a research affiliate with Dr. Sybil Derrible in the UIC Department of Civil and Materials Engineering. David also serves on the UIC Engineering Alumni Association (EAA) board, developing and administering the Student Ambassador Program and expanding the EAA's outreach to UIC students and recent graduates. David is excited about UIC's growth and hopes to continue to promote the successes of UIC and the College of Engineering.                    UIC Logo        Engineering Alumni       Contact   851 S.
