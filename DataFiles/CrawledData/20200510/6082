ISAAC | NIH 1U01HL134042-01 Principal Investigators: Victor Gordeuk, University of Illinois at Chicago Lewis Hsu, University of Illinois at Chicago Abraham Wandersman, University of South Carolina Jana Hirschtick, Sinai Urban Health Institute           ISAAC overview brochure How might we leverage the culture of the community to enable better self-management and patient-provider conversations? Many Chicago adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience severe episodic and chronic pain, progressive organ damage, frequent hospitalizations and re-hospitalizations, fragmented care and alarmingly high mortality. Despite the heavy toll in human suffering and related disruption to daily life, relatively few resources are devoted to improving the lives of people with this condition. ISAAC is a study designed to improve clinical care and patient outcomes of people with sickle cell disease by designing, testing, and implementing an integrated model of longitudinal and emergency care.
