If you are enrolled in multiple sessions in summer, the sum of the credit hours from each session must add up to this required total for summer.  There is no separate financial aid application for summer. All degree-seeking students who have a 2019-2020 FAFSA on file with Office of Student Financial Aid will automatically be considered for financial aid.
