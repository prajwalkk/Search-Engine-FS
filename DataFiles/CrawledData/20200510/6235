The purpose of this program will be to allow internationally trained dentists develop an in-depth appreciation and understanding of an advanced periodontics curriculum. This fellowship program offers an individualized professional development program for dentists and dental specialists who are interested in advancing their knowledge in Periodontics and Oral Implantology. Individuals participating in this program will have the opportunity to attend periodontal seminars and lectures, observe periodontal faculty members and/or residents in a clinical setting and participate in research-related activities. This program will also serve as an opportunity for the non-US trained dentist to become familiar with the specialty, determine their level of interest for future formal residency training, demonstrate their interest in advanced training, and demonstrate familiarity with a wide range of periodontal and implant procedures.  Upon successful completion of the fellowship, fellows will have a potential advantage when applying for residency programs.  MISSION STATEMENT  The mission of this fellowship program is to provide interested non-US trained dental professionals exposure to the US dental education healthcare system and provide opportunities for advancing their knowledge and clinical experience in Periodontics and Implantology. This program will educate the non-US trained dentist to become familiar with the specialty, determine their level of interest for future formal residency training, demonstrate their interest in advanced training, and demonstrate familiarity with a wide range of periodontal and implant procedures.  This program aligns itself with several of the core missions of the University of Illinois College of Dentistry: educating oral health professionals and scholars who excel in a complex, multicultural and technologically challenging world, discovering and translating new knowledge at the boundaries of science, social systems and related technologies for the benefit of individuals, families and communities, and providing oral and health education & clinical services of the highest quality with an emphasis on enhancing health equity and social justice for individuals and communities.    GOALS  Fellows will follow the same clinic and experience a full range of clinical procedures performed in our advanced graduate residency clinics. These procedures include:  Regenerative and resective surgery for the treatment of periodontitis  Periodontal plastic surgery to correct acquired mucogingival defects  Crown lengthening surgery  Site development for implant placement (including guided bone generation and autogenous block grafts)  Implant surgery (conventional and computer guided)  Didactic courses are offered on the following:  Periodontal Treatment Planning/Therapy Seminar  Periodontal Literature Seminar  Basic Implantology  Anesthesia and Pain Control  Implant Diagnosis and Treatment Seminar  Advanced Craniofacial Anatomy  Advanced Oral Sciences  Radiology for the Dental Specialist  Participants will also participate in preclinical hands-on experiences in implant surgery and periodontal surgery utilizing porcine heads and models.
