Please welcome UIC Engineering Alumni back (virtually) to campus! Alumni who graduated around the Great Recession of 2009 will share stories of their successes and challenges while they were searching for a job during a very tough economic climate, similar to what they experienced when they graduated in 2009/2010.  This webinar is intended for students/recent alumni who are seeking a full-time job, although all students may find it useful.  ALL UIC students and alumni are welcome to attend.
