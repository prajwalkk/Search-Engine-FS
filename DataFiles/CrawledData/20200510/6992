Quick Reference Table  Travel Signatures: F and J Status Only  Automatic Visa Revalidation (AVR)  Entering the U.S. - General Information  Obtaining or Renewing Your Visa in Canada or Mexico  Visa for Entry to Canada/Mexico    General Travel Advice  Contact your airline prior to all travel, to inquire about transit  visas or any other requirements for travel both domestically and  internationally. A transit visa may be required, even for layovers in  countries other than your final destination. Please review TSA requirements prior to travel.    Visa     A visa is affixed in your passport by the U.S. Consulate or Embassy  abroad and allows you to travel to the U.S. It only needs to be valid  for your entry into the U.S., and does not have to remain valid  throughout your stay in the U.S., provided that you maintain your  immigration status. If you travel outside of the U.S. and need to  re-enter, you must have a valid/unexpired visa to return. There are  exceptions to this rule for travel to Canada, Mexico, and the adjacent  islands.* *See “Automatic Visa Revalidation” below.   Form I-94   An I-94 is an arrival and departure record that you receive at  the Port of Entry (such as the airport) when entering the U.S. Individuals arriving to the U.S. after 04/26/2013 may print the I-94 online . Prior to 04/26/2013 the I-94 was a paper form filled out at the Port of Entry or on the airplane. Your I-94 must remain valid at  all times. When departing the U.S., you will turn in your I-94 paper card (if applicable),  unless you are taking advantage of AVR.* If you forget to return your  I-94 when exiting the U.S. permanently, you should follow instructions to make an effort to send it back to Department of Homeland Security (DHS/immigration).     How Do I Obtain or Renew A Visa?   When applying for a new visa, please find out:   whether an appointment is required, and how long it may take to process your request.  what documents, forms, photos and fees are required  if they allow visa applications from third country nationals (“TCNs”)    Be prepared to show evidence of your financial resources.  Bring appropriate immigration documents: Form I-20, DS-2019, or I-797 (See “Quick Reference Table” below)  If an initial F-1 or J-1, pay the SEVIS fee .  Schedule a flight that allows sufficient time for you to obtain a  visa.  Additional security checks are possible for certain individuals,  which may result in delays of 30+ business days.  Make sure your passport is valid for 6 months from date of visa application.  Check with local U.S. Embassy or Consulate for possible additional documentation needed.  If you need a new visa and you travel outside the U.S., be aware  that you are never guaranteed that a new visa will be issued, especially  if you apply at a U.S. embassy or consulate in a country other than  your home country.  If you travel to a country other than your home country, you may  need a visa to enter that country.  Check that country’s immigration  website for more information.  You may need a transit visa if arriving in a third country en route to another country.  If you have changed status within the U.S. and now want to travel  outside of the U.S., you will need to obtain a new entry visa to match  your current status to return to the U.S.  Canadian citizens: no visa required except for statuses A, G, E, K, and V A passport is required for air travel, but not necessarily by land or sea .

To take  advantage of AVR your travel must be to contiguous territories and for  less than 30 days.  Rules governing AVR are found in the United State’s Code of Federal Regulation .    Contiguous countries are: Canada, Mexico, and the adjacent islands:  Saint Pierre, Miquelon, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Bermuda, the  Bahamas, Barbados, Jamaica, the Windward and Lee Islands, Trinidad,  Martinique, the other British, French and Netherlands territories or  possessions in or bordering on the Caribbean Sea  Does not apply to individuals from Cuba, Syria, Sudan or Iran  Do not surrender your paper I-94 card when departing U.S.  If the flight attendant or officer asks for a paper I-94 politely inform them that you are taking advantage of the AVR provision  Only for travel less than 30 days  Not valid for people who travel from a contiguous  territory, such as Canada, to a non-contiguous country, such as Germany,  and return to the U.S. via a contiguous territory  H-1B workers are only allowed to take advantage of  AVR for travel to Canada and Mexico ONLY Mexican nationals traveling to  Mexico, must have a valid U.S. visa to reenter the U.S.  If you have changed your status while in the U.S. and hold a visa  for the previous status, you may still take advantage of AVR, as long as  you bring the supporting documents for your new status (see the “Quick Reference Table” above).  For example, you changed your status from F-1 to H-1B, but still only have an expired F-1 visa; you may still use AVR.      Entering the U.S. – General Information    For the most accurate information regarding entry procedures to the U.S., please see the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol website .  At this site you will find information regarding customs regulations,  AVR, Form I-94, the Visa Waiver Program and other useful updates to help  you with your travels to the U.S.    Obtaining or Renewing Your Visa in Canada or Mexico     First, check to see if you need a visitor visa to enter Canada or Mexico (see “Visas for Canada/Mexico” below). Canada and Mexico have their own immigration systems and have  different bi-lateral agreements with each country regarding visas.  Research the procedure for making a visa appointment in your desired consulate.   Canada    Visa Appointment Information  Consulates: Calgary, Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Quebec City, Toronto, Vancouver    Mexico    Visa Appointment Information   Consulates: Ciudad Juarez, Guadalajara, Hermosillo, Matamoros, Merida, Mexico City, Monterrey, Nogales, Nuevo Laredo and Tijuana      Check current visa processing wait times with the Department of State.  Wait at least 5 days after booking the appointment before purchasing  your ticket for travel.  The  Consulate may make cancellations during  that time.  If you miss your appointment, you may be charged a fee, unless  canceled in advance. If you miss your appointment and do not cancel in  time, you will not be allowed to make another one until 3 months after  the date of your original appointment.  Automatic visa revalidation will no longer be available if  you apply for a new U.S. entry visa in Canada, Mexico or the adjacent  islands.    The visa must be approved before you can reenter the U.S. If the  visa is denied, or subject to a security check, you must return to your  home country to obtain a new visa and may not use AVR.  If the visa application requires a security check, you cannot  reenter the U.S. under automatic visa revalidation while the application  is pending.        Visas For Entry to Canada/Mexico    You may require a visa to enter Canada/Mexico.
