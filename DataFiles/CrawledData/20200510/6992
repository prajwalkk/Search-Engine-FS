Regarding your DS-2019 there are several important places to check for accuracy:   Box 3 :  Dates    The start date is extremely important! You may  enter the U.S. up to 30 days before the start date.  Once you enter the  U.S. you must check-in with OIS no later than 30 days after your start  date. (See “Check-in at OIS” section).  If you do not check-in, you will  be out of immigration status and unable to participate as a J-1 at UIC.    Box 5 : Funding   Funding information should cover the start to end date of your  DS-2019.  If you will receive UIC funding, it will state “Current  Program Sponsor Funds” and the amount.    Box 4 : Subject/Field   The description of your subject/field should be accurate.  You may  have a very specialized research project or objective, however, it  should be related to the more general description listed here.      Applying for a visa  In order to apply for your J-1 visa (and J-2 dependent visas) you will need to do the following:    Pay the SEVIS Fee at least 3 business days before applying for your J-1 visa.  The SEVIS fee is a one-time fee for each  nonimmigrant program in which the exchange visitor participates.  J-2s  do not need to pay a separate fee.  You will need to demonstrate proof  of payment before you can apply for a visa.  Once the payment is  submitted, a receipt can be printed, which can be used for immediate  verification of payment.  The fee can be paid by mail or electronically  at www.FMJfee.com .  It is possible  for a third party (such as a friend, relative, or other sponsor) to pay  the SEVIS fee for you.  If this option is selected, the person  completing the Form I-901 will need your information exactly as it  appears on your Form DS-2019.  Schedule a visa appointment at a U.S. Consulate or  Embassy (we always recommend applying for a visa in your home country,  if possible).  Present your DS-2019, proof of SEVIS fee payment, and any other documents as required by the embassy or consulate.   You may want  to visit the U.S. Department of State’s website in order to view estimated visa wait times and other information about  U.S. visas.  Once the visa is granted and stamped in your passport you  are ready to make travel arrangements to the United States.   Canadian citizens only : You do not need a J-1 visa, but you must present the DS-2019 form, any supporting  documentation, and proof of paying the SEVIS fee to an immigration  officer at the U.S. border or pre-flight inspection station.  In order  to enter the United States, you must have a passport .   Purchase health insurance  You are required to have health insurance (for you and your  dependents) that meets specific requirements.  You must purchase this  insurance before you arrive in the U.S.  Failure to provide proof of insurance will result in the loss of the J-1’s immigration status and termination in the Exchange Visitor  program.  Please see the enclosed “ Medical Insurance Policy Requirements ” page for more information.  Some sponsoring departments  may provide stipends to J-1 employees who do not qualify for UIC  insurance, please consult with your department regarding insurance stipends.  For those J-1 individuals funded by UIC that meet the IRS Substantial Presence Test and are classified as Resident Aliens for tax purposes, UIC may provide UIC health insurance benefits.  For more information regarding Payroll and Benefits, please see the Payroll and Benefits website.  Please note that UIC health insurance does not cover all of the requiremetns of J-1 Exchange Visitor program, thus all J-1s with UIC health insurance must purchase supplemental coverage that provides for medical evacuation and repatriation of remains.    If you purchase insurance in your home country, it must fulfill the  stated requirements and be endorsed by the home country’s government.   If the policy/card is not in English, we will need an English  translation of: company name, policy number, start and end dates.  We have also included a list of possible insurance companies in your J-1 Welcome Packet.   Preparing for life in Chicago  The “Life in Chicago” section of the OIS website has a variety of  information to help you prepare for your arrival in Chicago.   Information includes: climate, currency, public transportation, housing,  and other topics.  You may also want to visit the main UIC website’s  “Living” and “Visiting” links at www.uic.edu .   Arrival at the U.S. port-of-entry   Inspection at the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol: Upon arrival you must present your passport and Form DS-2019 to the  immigration officer.  The officer may ask you for additional  information: for example, evidence of financial support or a letter of  invitation from your academic department.  The inspector should stamp your passport and write "J-1" until "D/S" indicating "duration of status."  As of 4/30/2013, all arrival/departure information will be stored electronically.  The Exchange Visitor should provide a printout of his or her arrival/departure information, which can be obtained from the Customs and Border Patrol website at i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94 .  US-VISIT: Also known as, “U.S. Visitor and  Immigration Status Indication Technology” system.  This is a “check-in”  mechanism that records the entry of all foreign visitors to the U.S.   The US-VISIT stations will scan your fingerprints and take your  photograph.  This information will be checked against national security  and law enforcement databases.   Please note: The DS-2019 you have received from UIC is valid for participation at the specific UIC department you have indicated, only .   You may not enter the U.S. with UIC’s DS-2019 and decide to  “immediately transfer” to another institution.  Transfers may be  possible later in your stay, but you must first check-in with OIS.        Check-in at OIS    Don’t forget to check-in at
OIS!  Our office is required, by federal regulation, to validate your
arrival in the U.S. through the SEVIS database within 30 days of your start
date. SEVIS is our mechanism for confirming your arrival to the U.S. and
reporting that information to the appropriate government agencies.  If you
arrive in the U.S., but fail to report to OIS within 30 days of your start date
or fail to provide proof of insurance, your participation in the J-1 program
will be invalidated, carrying severe consequences.  Before coming to OIS, you should
visit your academic “host” department.  The next step is to check-in with
our office.  Check-in times are Monday and
Thursday at 2:00 p.m.  If you are not able to come at
this time due to a scheduling conflict, please ask your department
administrator to call our office to schedule a personal appointment at a time
convenient for you.  When you come to check-in please bring:   Immigration documents: passport, DS-2019, and I-94
    arrival/departure card or printout  Proof of insurance  Your current, complete, U.S. address information.  (It is
    fine to have a hotel or friend’s address.)   During the check-in process, you
will be invited to one of our monthly EV (Exchange Visitor) Scholar Orientations . New Exchange Visitors are legally required to attend
Orientation.  We will review the benefits
and limitations of your immigration status; travel and visa procedures; and
adjusting to life and customs in the U.S. while highlighting campus and city
resources.   Other considerations  Delayed entry:  If your visa is  delayed at the consulate, or if there are other unforeseen occurrences  which will prevent you from reporting to OIS within 30 days of your  start date, you must communicate this with your department as soon as  possible.  The OIS advisor may be able to amend your start date.     Dependents: A dependent is only a spouse or unmarried child under the age of 21 years.  Dependents are considered “J-2s.”  It is possible to have your dependent join you in the U.S.  at a later time.  After your arrival and check-in at OIS, you could  later show documentation that you have adequate funding to support your  J-2 dependents.  Two-year home residency requirement:  This potential requirement is explained on Page 2 of your DS-2019.  We will talk about this  regulation in greater detail after you arrive and attend the required  Orientation.     Social Security Numbers (SSNs):  Please  note that according to Social Security Administration regulations, one  is not eligible to apply for an SSN unless he or she is employed by a  U.S. institution.  If UIC is not funding your J-1 program, you will not  be eligible to apply for an SSN.  We will discuss SSNs, driver’s  licenses, and other identification numbers at your Check-in appointment  and at your post-arrival Orientation.  You may also see our website for additional SSN information.    xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
