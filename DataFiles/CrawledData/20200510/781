Over 800 new students from all over the world joined the UIC family at the New International Student Summit in August. That day, they became part of an already flourishing international community at UIC. The "Mapping the Global Community" event at the summit showed the vast range of cultures incoming students were bringing and gave students the opportunity to highlight their home country. After placing their pin on the map, each student was able to greet Chancellor Amiridis and Vice Provost for Global Engagement, Neal McCrillis, to receive a UIC Global button to wear around campus.
