The dependents of an  F-1 visa holder are granted an F-2 visa.  F-2 visa holders are not  allowed to work or study. If you receive an I-20 document from UIC, you should apply for an F-1 visa.  The J-1 student visa is more appropriate for students who  are on exchange visits or sponsored programs. J-1 student visas are  usually issued when a student receives most or all of their funding from  their home government or a U.S. governmental agency. The dependents of a  J-1 visa holder are granted J-2 visas.  J-2 visa holders may enroll in  school and apply for work authorization. If you receive a DS-2019 document, you should apply for a J-1 visa.  Caution : Individuals are not eligible to register for classes if their visa  status is B1/B2, WB/WT-Visa Waiver or F2 (Dependent of F1).  If you have  any questions about visa types, please email newintl@uic.edu.     Obtaining a visa for initial entry to the U.S .   What is a visa? A visa is a stamp in your passport from the  U.S. Consulate or Embassy abroad that permits you to apply for entry  into the U.S. at a Port of Entry. It only needs to be valid for your entry into  the U.S. and does not have to remain valid throughout your stay  provided that you maintain your immigration status. This means that as  long as you remain within U.S. borders, your visa is allowed to expire.  However, your I-20 or DS-2019 must remain valid for the duration of your  stay in the U.S.  How to obtain a visa. Once you are admitted to the  University of Illinois at Chicago, you will need to obtain a student  visa for your initial entry to the U.S.  OIS will send you an I-20 or DS-2019. Once you have this document,  you should review it to make sure the information is correct and sign  the document. Please email newintl@uic.edu if you have any questions or  concerns about your document.    The following are recommended steps when applying for your F-1/J-1 visa:   Pay the SEVIS fee . Once  you pay, you will receive a receipt of payment that you must keep. You  will need to present the receipt at your visa interview. You will also  need this receipt notice for travel and future visa renewals.  Contact the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate to schedule a visa appointment.      SEVIS stands for the “Student and Exchange Visitor    Information System.” It is a database maintained by the Department of    Homeland Security and allows U.S. agencies to track visitors for the  duration   of their stay.     You may have   applied and been accepted to several institutions. Before   applying for a visa ,  you must decide which institution you would like to   attend. This is  important because the name of the institution on your I-20 or   DS-2019  must match the visa in your passport for your initial entry to the U.S.      To obtain a visa, you need to prepare the following documents for your visa interview:   Valid passport for at least 6 months    I-20 or DS-2019 form prepared by UIC    Your admission letter to UIC    One passport size photograph (2X2)    SEVIS fee payment receipt    DS-160 Online           Nonimmigrant Visa Application    Proof of payment of Machine Readable Visa (MRV) fee    Visa reciprocity fee (if applicable)    Evidence of financial ability to meet expenses    Evidence of English ability sufficient for course of study    Evidence of intent to depart the U.S. after completion of studies    Any other documents listed on the website of your Consulate or  Embassy   You should be prepared to show:   Transcripts and diplomas from previous institutions attended;  Scores from standardized tests required by the educational institution such as the TOEFL, SAT, GRE, GMAT, etc.   Applicants with dependents must also provide:   Proof of the student’s relationship to his/her spouse and/or children (e.g., marriage and birth certificates.);  It is preferred that families apply for F-1 and F-2 visas at the  same time, but if the spouse and children must apply separately at a  later time, they should bring a copy of the student visa holder’s  passport and visa, along with all other required documents.      The visa interview is not a   document review, but a  conversation. If you are denied a visa, make sure to   get the decision  in writing.     Importance of Name Consistency   To avoid problems or delays in obtaining your visa and entering the  U.S., be sure that all of your immigration documents reflect the same  name, exactly as it appears in your passport .  Do not use nicknames or shortened names on any of your documents,  including your passport, I-20 or DS-2019, entry visa stamp, I-94 card  (completed in the airplane before arrival for individuals arriving before 04/26/2013) and any additional  documents that you acquire after your arrival in the U.S.  Visa Wait Times  Visa wait times vary from country to country. The U.S. Department of  State offers  average wait times. In general, it is important for students to  apply  for their visa as soon as they have all the necessary documents,  ideally  at least 120 days before the start of the semester.  Certain nonimmigrant visa applicants are subject to additional administrative processing and/or  security clearances before being issued a visa. This involves  the U.S.  Consulate or Embassy checking the visa applicant’s name  against  information in various Department of State (DOS) databases or a  security  advisory opinion.  At the initial visa interview, the applicant should provide clear and   concise information about their past activities and future plans while   in the U.S. In most cases , the visa is issued within 60 days.   Planning Your Arrival Date   F-1 Students:  Immigration regulations allow entry into the U.S. up to 30 days  before the start date on the I-20.  If you are unable to arrive by your  start date, please consider deferring (or delaying) your admission to  the next semester. If you are a graduate student, you must first defer  your admission with your department. Please notify OIS if you plan to  defer.  J-1 Students:  The DS-2019 has been prepared for the period of time indicated in  Section 3 of the form. You may enter the U.S. up to 30 days before the  start date.  For F-1 and J-1 students:  Plan your arrival date in Chicago so you can:   Rest for a few days and recover from jetlag  Check-in with the Office of International Services (OIS)  Find housing (see the housing section later in this document)  Attend the International Student Orientation Program  Attend your college and/or department orientation program  Register for classes .  Keep in mind that if you start your program in Summer, then you must be  registered for full-time in your first summer semester.      Entering the U.S.   You may want to prepare for your entry into the U.S. by visiting the website of Customs and Border Patrol .  Additionally,  when you enter the U.S., an immigration officer (at the  port of entry) will review your immigration documents (visa,  I-20/DS-2019, valid passport).   You will be issued an electronic form I-94 Arrival/Departure card that can be view and printed online . (Individuals that arrived prior to 04/26/2013 received a small white paper card that they completed in the airplane or at the border.) For F-1 and J-1 students, the I-94 should indicate an authorized stay of D/S (Duration of Status), which allows you to stay in the U.S. as long as you maintain your student status.  Page 1 of Form I-20/DS-2019 will be stamped, indicating the date in  which you entered the country, your immigration status (e.g. F-1 or J-1)  and your authorized length of stay D/S (Duration of status).  Please  verify this information before you leave the “check-in” area.   The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has developed a system  called the U.S. Visitor and Immigration Status Indicator Technology  (US-VISIT). This system records the entry and exit of all foreign  visitors to the U.S.  An immigration official scans each visitor’s  fingerprints, takes your photograph, and checks them against national  security and law enforcement databases.   After you pass through immigration, you’ve officially arrived. Welcome to the United States!     The   documents you receive at the US port of entry are proof that  you entered the   United States legally. Please keep all of your  immigration documents in a   safe place.    If you need assistance while at O’Hare Airport, you may   visit  the Travelers Immigrant Aid Office located in Terminal 2 across from the    Children’s Playground. It is open Monday-Friday 8:30am–9pm and  Saturday and   Sunday 10am–9pm. In terminals 1, 2 and 3, there are  information booths with   multilingual personnel who provide assistance.  The phone number is   1-773-894-2427.              Completing the Form I-94 for Nonimmigrant Students    Use all CAPITAL letters. Use English. Use standard United States    characters and print clearly . Letters like ñ, é, ü, ç are not recognized by U.S. data systems. (Instead, use n, e, u or c.)  Name (Blocks 1, 2, 14, and 15)  The family name (Blocks 1 and 14) is also referred to as surname or  last name. If you have only one name, enter it in the Family Name block.  Use the letters FNU in the First Name field. Spacing is as important as spelling and must be consistent. For example: data systems will not read Mc Millan and McMillan as the same name. Hyphens must not be used.    Print your name exactly as it appears on your Form I-20.    Date of Birth (Blocks 3 and 16) and Date Issued (Block 11): Your date of birth must be given in Day/Month/Year order. This is not the same order that appears on your Form I-20 or Form DS-2019 .  For example: if you were born on the 9th day of January in the year  1986, you should write 090186 in the Birth Date block (Blocks 3 and 16).  The same date format is used in block 11 for Date Issued.  Country of Citizenship (Blocks 4 and 17): In the  Country of   Citizenship block enter the country that issued your  passport. You can find the U.S. spelling in block 1 of the Form I-20  under the “Country of Citizenship.” It is on the second line of the Form  DS-2019 under “Citizenship Country.”    Medical Insurance Policy Requirements for All Students  Additional Medical Insurance Policy Requirements for J-1 Students     Immunization Requirements  All students living on campus are required to fulfill the immunization requirements mandated by Illinois state law. We recommend that you obtain all the  necessary immunizations before you arrive in the U.S. You are required  to turn in a completed immunization form to the university before the  end of your first semester of study. If you fail to comply with the  immunization requirements, a hold will be placed on your registration  the following semester.  You may download the immunization form from the  Office of Admissions & Records website .    xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
