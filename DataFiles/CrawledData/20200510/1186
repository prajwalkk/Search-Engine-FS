Their voicemail varies in feature sets, from the simple legacy “phone answering” service in analog phones, to the newest system in the VoIP phones, which delivers unified messaging, meeting, calling capabilities, and virtual voicemail.  NOTE: ACCC is in the process of moving all VoIP voicemail users to a new system called Unity. Information will be communicated to users as the migrations are scheduled.
