Examples of OER include: full courses, course modules, syllabi, lectures, homework assignments, quizzes, lab and classroom activities, pedagogical materials, games, simulations, and many more resources contained in digital media collections from around the world.” - OER Commons           OER Resources allow users to:      Retain -- users have the right to make, archive, and own copies of the content  Reuse -- content can be reused in its unaltered form  Revise -- content can be adapted, adjusted, modified, and altered  Remix -- original or revised content can be combined with other content to create something new  Redistribute -- copies of the content can be shared with others in its original, revised or remixed form.   http://opencontent.org/     OER resources are free to access online, free to share, free to re-use, and typically are share under a Creative Commons License, allowing other s to copy, distribute, or revise the OERs for their own purposes.               Why Open Education Resources? The issues:      College textbook prices have increased 812% since 1978. The Consumer Price Index has increased 250% during this time. (Perry, 2012) (1)  The average student in the U.S. spends $1100 to $1200 annually on textbooks. (2)  Because of high textbook costs (3)   64% of students didn't purchase a textbook because of cost  45% of students didn't register for a course  49% took fewer courses  27% dropped a course  21% withdrew from a course  17% failed a course      Sources:  1) Perry, M.
