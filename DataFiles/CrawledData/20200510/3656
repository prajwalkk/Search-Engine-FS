The course will include (i) introduction to dentistry (ii) basics of clinical procedures (iii) basics of restorative dentistry/implants (iv) basics of endodontics (v) biomaterials used in dentistry (vi) biomechanics aspects in dentistry/TMJ disorder (vii) clinical concerns/challenges (viii) surgery room animations (ix) new drug delivery system. Students will be able to understand the basics of dental science. They will also learn the advancements in dentistry, such as new biomaterials, biosensors, and diagnostic tools. This course is suitable for students who are interested in pre-dental or research related to dental/oral science. It is open to undergraduate and graduate students in bioengineering, biological science, applied heath science, mechanical engineering, or materials engineering.        BioE 494 / CS 494 Wearables and Nearables Technology Laboratory         BioE 494 / CS 491 Wearables and Nearables Technology Laboratory   Over the past decade, wearables and nearables technologies have revolutionized and quantified multiple aspects of our lives including sports, fitness, entertainment, medicine, and health monitoring. In this course, we will learn how to design and fabricate wearables and nearables devices. The course provides the opportunity to work in cross-disciplinary groups and develop the skill set needed to be part of this emerging field. This new, exciting class combines various sensors, software platforms, and Bluetooth technology to create wearable and nearable devices. An open-ended project module will allow you the option to collaborate with a selected industry partner on a real-world problem, potentially leading to a future internship. This course is open to a total of 32 undergraduate and graduate students in bioengineering, computer science, or electrical and computer engineering. Students must have a background in circuit design via ECE 115 and ECE 210.
