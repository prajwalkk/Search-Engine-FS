Furthermore, we are committed to increasing the recruitment, enrollment, and retention of students with a special interest in community based practice and the provision of care to children and the underserved. There are links listed on the right side of this page.    Illinois PreDental Consortium  There is no membership or fee. Simply join your school's predental club! Be sure to provide your leadership team information including email address to our staff, especially if you are a newly formed club. The Illinois PreDental Consortium (IPDC) is a collaborative effort by the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Dentistry to:  Connect Illinois pre-dental students on a state-wide level to share resources and interests,  Increase pre-dental mentoring,  Educate pre-dental students on oral health disparities in the state, and  Increase access to care for children in Illinois.  Predental Consortium clubs include Benedictine University, Chicago State University, DePaul University, Dominican University, Illinois Institute of Technology, Loyola University, Northwestern University, University of Illinois-Champaign, Illinois State University, Roosevelt University, Southern Illinois University, St. Xavier University, and University of Illinois-Chicago. We learn from each other, so if your club is interested in doing more networking and joining the consortium, please contact Ms. Carolyn Feller at cfeller@uic.edu . You are also invited to visit the UIC Predental Club’s homepage to stay up to date on news and events.    Predental Collection of Teeth  Being a predental student  allows you to explore many aspects of the profession and prepare for entrance into dental school. This includes shadowing, taking science courses and performing community service.  Another important aspect of preparing for dental school is the collection of teeth. Dental  students at the UIC College of Dentistry will take courses where the biology of the human dentition and practice for preparing teeth restoration is taught.  Faculty expect that our students  collect teeth. Collection of teeth can take time, so we recommend starting  this process during your undergraduate years.  We recommend accumulating a minimum of 100 teeth.  UIC has provided predental students with guidance and a teeth collection letter that you can present to dentists that you can take to dentists (especially oral surgeons) to prepare for dental school.  Guidelines must be strictly followed to avoid hazardous materials contact.      GPPA  The Guaranteed Professional Program Admissions (GPPA) is available to high school students who apply to the UIC undergraduate program for acceptance into several health colleges including the College of Dentistry. Students do not apply to the College of Dentistry, but instead apply to undergraduate Admissions where they must maintain certain criteria. It is recommended that prospective students request a tour of the UIC Undergraduate campus here. Once enrolled, GPPA students meet monthly at the College of Dentistry and are exposed to a wide variety of topics in dentistry.
