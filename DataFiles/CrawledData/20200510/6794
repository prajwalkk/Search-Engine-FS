This application will allow you to use your financial aid at UIC over the summer. Contact your home school financial aid office to determine if you have financial aid available. Please make sure to follow the process your home school outlines for applying for summer financial aid. If you are not eligible for financial aid, use the Summer Session Only application.  If you do not have financial aid available at UIUC/UIS, you can apply as a Summer Session Only Student .Â As a Summer Session Only student, you are not eligible to apply for financial aid directly at UIC because you will be attending as a nondegree student. You may be eligible for private loans for summer. Contact your home school financial aid office for more information. You can also visit the UIC Office of Student Financial Aid  for information on private loans.
