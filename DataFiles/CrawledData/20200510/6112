Through monthly meetings, the OVCHA convenes partners of all health sciences related units to participate in strategic and tactical conversations about communication priorities and projects. We are also available to consult and advise on appropriate communication measures and strategy that allow for the UI Health enterprise to remain interconnected among the University of Illinois at Chicago and our clinical delivery system.
