We also administer or liaise with funding agencies for additional opportunities. In Graduate College parlance, “fellowships” carry a stipend, for one or multiple years, as well as a tuition and partial fee waiver; they are used both to recruit new students and to help current students to complete their studies. “Awards” promote research, provide funds for a unique experience, or highlight achievement.  The majority of the Graduate College’s internal awards and fellowships are reviewed by our elected faculty awards committees, which are split into four disciplinary divisions: Arts and Humanities (AH), Behavioral and Social Sciences (BSS), Engineering, Math, and Physical Sciences (EMPS), and Life Sciences (LS).  Our funding opportunities appear below, first fellowships and then awards. Most are run through the Fellowships Office; however, since submission policies vary, instructions should be read carefully.    Graduate College's Fellowships Office         Graduate College Professional Success Program (PSP)   Under the direction of Theresa Christenson-Caballero, the Graduate College works with other units on campus as well as in the greater Chicago area to provide guidance, resources, workshops, and programs to support its fellows, both academically and professionally.    Click for more information         Fellowships   The Graduate College offers several fellowships to support University of Illinois at Chicago graduate students. Students do not apply directly for these awards. Instead, academic programs submit nominations. Students who wish to be nominated should contact their director of graduate studies (DGS) for details.  Except where noted, Graduate College fellowships carry a stipend of $25,000 as well as a tuition and partial fee waiver. Recruitment fellowships are multi-year funding packages that include fellowship years as well as an academic program-provided employment period which may be “topped” off up to the value of the fellowship stipend. Retention/completion fellowships are for a single year of stipend along with the waiver.       Pipeline to an Inclusive Faculty (PIF) Fellowship         Pipeline to an Inclusive Faculty (PIF) Fellowship   Acknowledging the lack of diversity in faculty around the country, we wanted to build a program at UIC to recruit and support outstanding underrepresented PhD students, who are interested in pursuing careers as faculty members.Our intent is to support these students with competitive funding packages, skills and professional development opportunities and mentoring in order to ensure their success in graduate school and in their future careers. Nomination by the academic program is required.    Full description and instructions.

Provost's Graduate Internship Award         Provost's Graduate Internship Award   Increasingly, graduate students are seeking positions outside the traditional tenure-track professoriate. To this end, the Graduate College has greatly enhanced its career and professional development offerings to help graduate students consider new career options and to build translatable skills.

Students in programs with mandatory internships as part of their curriculum are ineligible. Full description and instructions.        Provost's Graduate Research Award         Provost's Graduate Research Award   Since its inception in 2009, this award has supported multidisciplinary scholarship to expose students to varied research and creative fields. The award mechanism has naturally evolved into a way for students early in their studies to develop new research directions for their PhD dissertations or terminal degree thesis/capstone project and has been used by graduate programs as a way for students to practice writing research proposals. Funding is available for pilot grants (or preliminary research) to help students to develop stronger applications for funding from external sources.    Full description and instructions.          Public Service Graduate Internship Award (new)         Public Service Graduate Internship Award (new)   The Graduate College at the University of Illinois has created a new award in order to fund graduate students who are suddenly unfunded for the summer due to the global pandemic.  Inspired by the New Deal and its public work projects as well as by the university’s own mission, the Graduate College has created the Public Service Graduate Internship Award (PSGIA). This paid summer experience allows UIC graduate students to serve in the interest of the public good while obtaining valuable “hands-on” experience, albeit virtually. In addition to service for the public good, students receive virtual experience in academic, administrative, and student service units at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

Graduate College Tuition & Fee Waivers   University of Illinois provides a limited reserve of waivers to the UIC Graduate College, which we then award to programs in three ways: allocated per semester, for students who have won individual internal and external fellowships, and for students selected for external training grants by programs.
