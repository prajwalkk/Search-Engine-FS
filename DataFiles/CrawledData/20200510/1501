Civil engineers oversee the smart and responsible design and creation of structures and systems that are familiar to all of us: roads, bridges, buildings, airports, sewer systems, and more. Increasingly they are concerned not only with the what of the world around us, but the how : the ways in which people live in and utilize the built environment, and how we can optimize that for the benefit of human beings and the planet.  Civil engineering is a field with many pathways, and a UIC education will open them for you. Students who pursue an undergraduate major in civil engineering may find themselves drawn to careers in structural engineering (including designing structures to manage an increasing incidence of natural disasters), urban planning, coastal preservation, transportation engineering, water-resources management, materials science, environmental engineering, and beyond.  Your vision of your future career will be shaped by your UIC coursework, the faculty mentors you encounter here, and the strong support of your fellow students.       Civil Engineering Major Requirements    Civil engineering majors complete coursework in three categories:   Nonengineering and general education courses: Nonengineering and general education courses will make you a well-informed graduate in disciplines outside of civil engineering. You will take 55 credit hours in this category, including chemistry, physics, math, and a range of “chart-your-own-path” classes in areas such as Exploring World Cultures and Understanding the Individual and Society. For details on general education requirements, consult the course catalog .  Required engineering courses: Students earn 64 credit hours from engineering courses that all civil engineering majors must take. These courses—including Strength of Materials, Environmental Engineering, and Geometric Design of Highway Facilities—offer a thorough introduction to the field. Details on these requirements are in the course catalog .  Technical electives: Civil engineering majors complete 9 credit hours of courses that will prepare them for the specific careers or research they have in mind. Options include Design of Masonry Structures, Railroad Track Engineering, Engineering Hydrology, Bridge Design I, and more (see the course catalog for details).

These are called our program educational objectives .  Graduates of the civil engineering program at the University of Illinois at Chicago will establish careers in engineering, research and development, and/or management professions and will be involved in professional societies. Within a few years of completing the program, graduates are expected:   To apply technical expertise, effective design skills, and sustainability principles to address evolving engineering challenges affecting a diverse society.  To be engaged in continuing education. Motivated graduates will have pursued or have well-formulated plans to pursue graduate education.  To effectively and ethically contribute as a member, manager, or leader of multidisciplinary teams through efficient communication of technical and nontechnical issues.   Civil engineering is a regulated profession, meaning that a majority of professionals in the field will become licensed Professional Engineers within five years of graduation. To attain this license, a civil engineering student must take and pass the Fundamentals of Engineering exam to become certified as an Engineer-in-Training. A new civil engineer then must take the Principles of Engineering exam. When that exam is passed, and when the new civil engineer has successfully demonstrated sufficient evidence of work experience and other qualifications required by the state and jurisdiction in which he or she works, the Professional Engineer license will be awarded. The PE license is highly regarded in the industry and opens doors to many successful and rewarding careers.  Civil engineering graduates who choose to practice structural engineering also will need to become licensed Structural Engineers within 10 years of their graduation.       Student Outcomes: Civil Engineering Major   Another part of the ABET accreditation process requires our department to identify the specific knowledge and skills that students are intended to have when they complete their undergraduate education. These are called student outcomes.  Students graduating from the civil engineering program at UIC will have:   an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics.  an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors.  an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences.  an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts.  an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives.  an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions.  an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.   In the 2019-2020 academic year, 353 students were enrolled at UIC Engineering as civil engineering majors across all class years. The department graduated 70 civil engineering majors in the academic year ending May 2019.      Apply to UIC!
