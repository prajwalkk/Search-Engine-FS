Participants will also have an opportunity to work with world-renowned professors, meet COE students, make new friends, and earn a stipend upon successful completion of the program!      TEST1         Overall, I think WIESP is an amazing program that encourages women to try engineering and bring more awareness to others… I would suggest that anyone who has the slightest interest in engineering should try WIESP because they will walk away with a valuable experience!    - WIESP Participant          WIESP 2020 Application       We encourage students who have an affinity for math and/or science to apply!
