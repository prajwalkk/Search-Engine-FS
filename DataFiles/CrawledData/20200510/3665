Additional Information for PhD Applicants     Direct admission         Direct admission   Most PhD applicants already have earned (or are about to complete) an MS in bioengineering. However, exceptional applicants who seek to start the PhD with only an undergraduate degree may be considered for what is called “direct admission.”  Students who are admitted to the PhD program with only a bachelor’s degree in bioengineering or a related field must complete at least 48 hours of coursework for the PhD, of which 24 semester hours must be bioengineering courses and of which at least 20 hours must be at the 500 level, excluding BIOE 595, BIOE 596, and BIOE 599. A maximum of 4 hours of BIOE 590 may be applied toward the degree.        MD/PhD track supported by NIH         MD/PhD track supported by NIH   UIC bioengineering also participates in the prestigious NIH-supported Medical Scientist Training Program, a competitive MD/PhD track providing seven years of funding support in collaboration with the UIC College of Medicine, home of the largest medical school in the United States.
