UIC has adopted the definitions of Interprofessional Education from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Collaborative for the Advancement of Interprofessional Education (CAIPE) . Both definitions describes specific characteristics of interprofessional education.  These definitions both state that IPE involves groups of 2 or more learners – and these learners are learning with, from and about each other for purposes of  developing collaboration skills.  Uses for the database include:   A source of ideas for developing additional IPE learning experiences  A mechanism for connecting faculty across health academic programs to explore ways that additional students could participate  A record of activities that can be used in Health Science Colleges accreditation processes, reports, and grant applications   Please complete one posting for each activity.  All activities will be reviewed before getting posted on the website. If there are any questions you will be contacted by the moderator of the site.  Please use the FORM to post information about interprofessional practice and education learning experiences that you are currently providing to UIC Students.  Thank you for your contribution.
