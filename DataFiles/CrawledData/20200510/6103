Student and faculty investigators in UIC’s seven health sciences colleges enjoy an interdisciplinary research environment, access to advanced research facilities, support for research design and data analysis and the ability to engage with a diverse patient population through the University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System.  Researchers focus on both basic research to help better-understand disease processes and translational research that looks for ways to use discoveries made in the laboratory to help patients. UI Health also conducts more than 100 clinical research trials ranging from identifying the best treatments for childhood cancers, to learning how community outreach efforts can help patients in the community live healthier lifestyles.
