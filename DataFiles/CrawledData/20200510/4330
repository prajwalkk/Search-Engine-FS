Pharmacists practice in a variety of settings, including community pharmacies, hospitals, drug industries, and government agencies. Pharmacists may provide patient care, teach at colleges and universities, or may perform pharmaceutical research.  The preprofessional course work listed below prepares the student to apply to the Doctor of Pharmacy program in the College of Pharmacy. The course work generally requires a minimum of two full-time academic years of study. Most students require at least three years to complete prerequisite course work.

Students apply for admission to the College of Pharmacy through the centralized application service (PharmCAS) sponsored by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy. Students should apply for admission approximately one year before enrollment. Pre-pharmacy students must take the Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT) prior to the PharmCAS application deadline. PCAT information is available online.  The minimum GPAs (cumulative, science/math, pre-pharmacy requirement/prerequisite) for application to the program in pharmacy are 2.50/4.00. A minimum grade of C must be earned in each pre-pharmacy course. Please note that C minus (C-) grades received at other academic institutions will not meet the minimum grade requirement regardless of the way UIC converts transfer grades into the UIC grade point system.  The College of Pharmacy accepts applications for the fall semester admission only. PharmCAS applications are available starting in June. The College of Pharmacy reviews applications on an ongoing basis beginning shortly after PharmCAS applications are made available in June. A UIC College of Pharmacy supplemental application is also required.
