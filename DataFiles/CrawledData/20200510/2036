GPPA stands for Guaranteed Professional Program Admissions. This UIC program guarantees a select number of incoming first year students a seat in the professional or graduate program of their choice provided students qualify upon completion of their undergraduate studies here at UIC. The students admitted through the program maintain their guarantee by fulfilling a list of Conditions of Acceptance which are requirements to prepare them for their graduate or professional school experience.   What is the advantage of the GPPA?   Although each GPPA program varies in size, curriculum, and design, all of the programs share the following advantages: pursuing undergraduate curricula at UIC, a community of scholars, early access to professionals in their field, and a guaranteed seat in their graduate or professional program.   Are the programs accelerated?  The programs are not designed as accelerated programs, although some students may finish their undergraduate degree early due to Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate credit. Most programs require that student complete a bachelor’s degree prior to entry into the graduate or professional program.   If I want to apply to more than one GPPA program, do I need to submit a separate application for each one?   Students may submit an application to only one GPPA program. Once admitted, students may not transfer between the programs. Students may only apply as incoming freshman, with the exception of GPPA law at IIT Chicago-Kent.   What are the residency requirements to be eligible for the GPPA?  A limited number of out-of-state students are accepted; however, the programs in the Colleges of Medicine and Dentistry are limited to Illinois residents only.  The GPPA Dentistry, Medicine and Public Health programs require that students be US Citizens or Permanent Residents at the time they complete their Common Application.   Are there minimum requirements to remain in the GPPA?  Yes. They vary from program to program and are included in the Current Student tab under ‘Conditions of Acceptance’   Do I have to be in the top 15% of my graduating class or are there exceptions if, for example, I had problems my freshman year?  No, there are no specific GPA or ranking requirements for applicants. The admissions process looks holistically at every applicant, so you can apply whether your school ranks or not.   What percent of applicants were admitted to the GPPA last year?  GPPA is only one path to graduate or professional school. The programs intestinally admit a small number of students each year and not all qualified students are offered a spot. For the Fall 2017 admission’s cycle, approximately 8% of Medicine applicants (55), 8% of Dentistry applicants (6), 13% for Nursing (14) and 39% of Pharmacy applicants (40) were admitted to the program.   Can transfer students apply to graduate or professional school through GPPA? If not, will this ever change?  GPPA is available only to beginning first year students. At this time, there are no plans to change the program, and no exceptions are made. For the ITT Chicago-Kent program, students can apply as incoming first year students or after completion of the first year at UIC.   Do GPPA students have to matriculate into the intended program? Can students apply to other graduate or professional programs?  GPPA acceptance is non-binding. The programs are designed for students who are confident in what they want to do in the future, but students are allowed to apply to other professional/graduate programs, or to change career paths (although students may not transfer between GPPA programs).   Do all GPPA students have to belong to the Honors College?  Most programs require Honors College membership. Participation in the Honors College provides academic support, community, and additional connection to faculty members. Those programs that do not require membership strongly recommend it.   Does GPPA membership have any additional costs? Do the programs offer financial aid for undergraduate or graduate school?  Neither being a part of the Honors College nor GPPA comes at any additional cost to undergraduates. GPPA offers no financial aid; however, all Honors College applicants are considered for a variety of scholarships. All graduate and professional schools have their own financial aid systems, which are separate from undergraduate aid.  Application Specifics  When exactly is the application deadline?   The application deadline is Midnight Eastern Time (11pm Central Time) on the posted deadline date found under “application guide.” Applicants are encouraged to submit their materials well in advance of the deadline. Submitting applications during business hours is also recommended so any technical issues can be addressed in a timely manner.   Do I have to submit more than one application for GPPA, UIC and the Honors College?  In order to apply to a GPPA program, all applicants must complete the Common Application, complete the UIC First Year Supplement which now includes the GPPA essay and the Honors College essay (where required for GPPA), and submit two letters of recommendation.   How do I set up an interview?  Applicants do not arrange their own interviews. Instead students will be contacted if they have been selected for an interview. Either someone from the graduate or professional program or someone from the Honors College will contact applicants to schedule an interview if one is required. Not all applicants are guaranteed an interview.   If I’m required to write an essay, what’s the topic?  Students are asked to write three separate essays as part of the entire application process.  One is a statement included in the Common Application, a second essay is an Honors College statement, which specifically asks your motivation for joining the Honors College and what you can bring to the Honors College community, and a third essay is the GPPA statement, which asks what is the advantage for you of a guaranteed path into your profession of choice.   Do I need to take the SAT-II or the ACT Writing Test?  No. The admissions process requires either your, SAT, SAT-I or ACT scores for consideration for a GPPA program.   Can I submit any supporting documents, such as awards, etc.?   The only materials that are considered are the materials listed on the application. Any other supporting documentation will not be forwarded to the department because it plays no role in decision making.  College of Medicine and College of Dentistry  How many seats are available in the College of Medicine?  There is no fixed number of seats available annually. Over the past ten years the College of Medicine has offered admission to between 43 and 55 applicants each year.   Why is the MCAT (Medical College Aptitude Test) still required if I’ve been guaranteed admission into the College of Medicine?  The MCAT is required nationwide for all medical schools and colleges. Having the scores of the GPPA participants allows the College of Medicine to assess the performance of the program. GPPA Medicine students are required to score the average of the previous year’s class, the exact score needed will be outlined in the Conditions of Acceptance. You will be required to retake the test if your MCAT score is below the college average. The test may be retaken up to three times until a minimum score is achieved. Guidance on test preparation is offered to all students.   Can I make an appointment for an interview with the College of Medicine or the College of Dentistry?  No. The college or a representative of the Honors College will contact you to arrange an interview. Not all applicants are guaranteed an interview.   If I want guaranteed admission into the College of Medicine, can I major in an undergraduate program other than pre-medicine?  Yes. GPPA Medicine students are welcome to choose from many of the majors offered at UIC. GPPA Medicine students have pursued a variety of majors in the past including Bioengineering, Biochemistry, Economics, English, Mathematics, Philosophy, Physics, and Psychology. Pre-medicine is an advising track and not a major at UIC.   I heard that the College of Medicine has more than one campus and that if I am admitted, I may be assigned to a campus other than Chicago?   The College of Medicine has three campuses in Chicago, Peoria, and Rockford. The College of Medicine will decide site placement at the time of application to the College of Medicine (i.e. one year prior to entry) based on the content of the application and the performance in the program, similar to the process used for traditional applicants. Please visit the College of Medicine website to discover more about each of the campuses.
