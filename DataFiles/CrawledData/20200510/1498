The natural world is an amazing, highly complex place that the bioengineering major will help you to understand. Perhaps equally amazing is the universe of approaches that human beings have identified—and are continuing to develop—to make our quality of life even better.  Studying bioengineering as an undergraduate at UIC will help you apply quantitative analysis and design to living systems and hybrid systems (which contain some living components). Many paths become open to you as a bioengineering major. Perhaps you want to become a bioengineer, designing smart replacements for tissue or bone, developing new tools for non-invasive medical imaging or diagnostics, or shaping molecules into revolutionary new drug therapies. Maybe you want to move on to medical school, dental school, graduate work in pharmacy, or law school with a focus on patent law.  No matter what part of bioengineering excites you the most, and whether you envision graduate school or industry work after graduation, the UIC bioengineering major will offer you solid preparation.  The bioengineering major is outlined in detail in the course catalog ; the information below provides an overview.    Looking for a Minor in Bioengineering?         Bioengineering Major Requirements   Bioengineering majors complete coursework in four categories:      Nonengineering and general education courses         Nonengineering and general education courses   Nonengineering and general education courses provide you with a foundation in the sciences and make you a well-informed graduate in disciplines outside of bioengineering. You will take 67 to 68 credit hours in this area, including fundamental courses in biology, chemistry, physics, and math, as well as a range of “chart-your-own-path” classes in categories such as Understanding the Past and Exploring World Cultures. For details on general education requirements, please consult the course catalog .        Required engineering courses         Required engineering courses   Students earn 39 credit hours from engineering courses that all bioengineering majors must take. These courses—including Bioinstrumentation and Measurement, Biotransport, and Biostatistics—offer a thorough introduction to the field. For details on these requirements, please consult the course catalog .        Selective engineering courses         Selective engineering courses   Students earn 13 to 16 credit hours in this group, which includes a course in computer science, a course in electrical and computer engineering, and three bioengineering electives. You have two or more choices in most of these categories. For an explanation of the options, see the course catalog .        Bioengineering concentration courses         Bioengineering concentration courses   Each student works with a faculty advisor to develop a slate of courses totaling 9 credits in one of the four bioengineering concentrations: bioinformatics, biomedical imaging, cell and tissue engineering, or neural engineering. Concentrations represent a specific research area or professional interest, a helpful distinguishing factor when you move on to graduate study or look for full-time jobs.

The department offers four concentrations, each of which requires that you complete a specific collection of courses. The concentration options are:      Bioinformatics         Typical Concentration Area Elective courses for Bioinformatics   The bioinformatics concentration brings together computer science, statistics, and molecular biology to explain how genetics directly affect the function of all living things. Students pursuing this option begin its requirements with BIOE 480 Introduction to Bioinformatics, which focuses on using computers to analyze gene sequences and other forms of biological information. They also learn how to use bioinformatics tools in BIOE 481 Bioinformatics Laboratory, which offers rigorous hands-on experience.  Important: The courses listed below are typical of Concentration Area Elective (CAE) courses chosen by Bioinformatics students. This is NOT a complete list of appropriate courses. Specific course choices should be made in consultation with the advisor. Appropriate CAE courses will provide depth in the discipline of Bioinformatics and help to make the student competitive for the position or program that will be entered after the B.S.
