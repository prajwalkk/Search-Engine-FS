Reporting FAQs     Who Must Report    With regard to students, if a supervisor, executive, administrative staff or faculty member observes sexual harassment or receives a sexual harassment complaint from a student, he or she is obligated to timely report the observation or complaint to the Office for Access and Equity at 312-996-8670 or oae@uic.edu .  With regard to employees, supervisors and persons in positions of authority are obligated to timely report any and all observations and complaints of discrimination and harassment to the Office for Access and Equity at 312-996-8670 or oae@uic.edu .  OAE staff is available to provide counsel and to facilitate effective resolutions.  Under the new Protection of Minors Policy, all University personnel must immediately report cases of suspected child abuse or neglect of minors (children under the age of 18) directly to the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) as soon as abuse or neglect is suspected. The duty to report under Illinois law applies to the suspected abuse or neglect of any individual under the age of 18 who is known to the employee, volunteer, or other designated individuals in his or her professional or official capacity. This includes both (a) minors who are currently enrolled at the University or accepted for enrollment (e.g., a 17 year-old student enrolled as an undergraduate); and (b) minors who are not enrolled or accepted for enrollment as students at the University but who participate in a University program designed for minors or who otherwise become known to University personnel in their official or professional capacity.      How Are Reports Reviewed?    All complaints of unlawful harassment and discrimination will be taken seriously.  During an investigation, all parties will receive an equal opportunity to be heard.  The privacy rights of all parties will be respected. While complete confidentiality cannot be promised, disclosure of allegations and findings will be made only to persons with a legitimate need to know.  Given the nature of discrimination, harassment, and sexual harassment, specific investigations and remedies will be determined on a case-by-case basis.  Parties will be notified of the outcome of the complaint and recommendations, if any, made by OAE. Recommendations may include but are not limited to training, discipline, and termination.  UIC policy prohibits retaliatory action against any person who engages in a good faith disclosure of alleged wrongful conduct to a designated University official or public body. It also prohibits retaliatory action towards anyone participating in an investigation of wrongful conduct, such as sexual harassment.
