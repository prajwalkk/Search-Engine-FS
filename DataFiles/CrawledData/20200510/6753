The time period between fall and spring semester, referred to here as Winter Break, will require residents who choose to stay on campus to pay an additional fee.  Winter Break Checkout  The Winter Break period between the fall and spring semesters is not covered by the Housing Agreement; however, residents may apply for Interim Housing in advance to remain in Campus Housing over Winter Break for an additional daily fee determined by area. Campus Housing does not require residents to move their belongings out of their units for the duration of Winter Break. Residents will be asked to follow “Winterim Protocol” as will be explained by their hall staff.  Residents not registered to stay over Winter Break will have their spaces checked by student staff members to ensure that all units are prepped for the winter months.  Personal Belongings and Relocations  Residents are not required to move their belongings out of their unit during Winter Break if they are returning to the same unit for the spring semester .  In situations where residents wish to relocate to a new unit for the spring semester, it is important that they submit their request to Campus Housing in advance and relocate before departing for Winter Break.  Semester break relocations are more involved as many factors have to be considered so as not to interfere with spring assignments and move-in process for new residents.  Winter Break Checkout Expectations  As residents are temporarily vacating their units for Winter Break, this particular checkout process focuses on ensuring that units are in a clean and functional condition to welcome new residents. For example, a new roommate could move in to a unit before the existing occupants return from Break. Checkout tasks are geared towards conserving energy used by appliances, ensuring proper sanitation, and securely locking premises until residents return.  Summer Break  Housing over the Summer Break offers various options for residents. A resident can stay for the summer even if they are not registered for a summer class. If a resident needs housing for dates between the end of the spring contract and the start of the summer contract, they should apply for Interim Housing. Summer contract start and end dates will be posted on the Campus Housing website during the spring semester.  In addition to the spring-to-summer interim and summer housing period, there is a summer-to-fall interim period that residents may apply for. These dates are designated for early fall arrivals or summer residents with contracts for the following academic year who wish to live on campus until the start of fall contracts.  All requests are accommodated based on availability. Our effort is to reduce the number of times a resident will move while residing in Campus Housing.
