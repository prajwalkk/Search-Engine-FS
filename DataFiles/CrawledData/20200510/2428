					related to Linux. Linux is an open source operating system that uses the Linux kernel. Because of its open nature Linux and the Linux kernel can be modified to suit a particular purpose. Thanks to this you can find Linux in many places such as your phone, a car, and even the United States Postal Service use Linux. Want to know more?
