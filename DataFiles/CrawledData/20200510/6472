But our excellence goes beyond rankings. You see it every day in the world-class faculty, brilliant researchers and amazing students. You see it in our expansive base of over 10,000 active, engaged alumni. You see it in donors giving of their time and talent.  It’s the spark inside everyone at the UIC College of Pharmacy.  Pharmacy is a transformational science. It turns knowledge into action, chemicals into cures, and students into dedicated professionals. It changes healthcare, it changes pharmaceutical care, and it changes lives.  Everything we do has a purpose – to impact people’s lives.  Investments from our alumni and friends provide immediate and continuing impact for our students, faculty, and mission.  Your investments and involvement transform our students’ experience and ultimate career outcomes.  Thank you for your inspiring support!
