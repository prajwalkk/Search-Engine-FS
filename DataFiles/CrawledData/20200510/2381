Have you seen people working in the CS Area with Leds and what looks like a processor and wonder what they are doing? Have you ever wondered what in the world is a Raspberry Pi? Come stop by SIG Micro and find out. We are a sig focused on learning about microcontrollers such as arduinos, Intel Galileos, and Raspberry Pi's(when used as microcontrollers). We will be doing various projects throughout the semester using arduinos.  SIG Leader  Zach Heine  Meetings Meeting Information: Day: Friday Time: 4pm Where: ACM Office  Arduino Uno This is a picture of the board we will be using throughout the semester for our projects.
