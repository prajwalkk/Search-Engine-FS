For someone with an intellectual or developmental disability, even a routine visit to the doctor can be an uncomfortable, even fearful, experience.  Medical advances mean people with IDD are living longer. However, compared to the general population, they experience disparities in access to health care and health outcomes, says disability researcher Kiyoshi Yamaki .  One reason, Yamaki says: society’s move away from deinstitutionalization means more people with IDD now live in the community and get their health care from providers who have little experience or training in treating people with IDD.  That’s why Yamaki collaborated with UIC family medicine faculty and a local nonprofit organization to establish an educational program that brings medical students and people with IDD together to eliminate stereotypes and break down barriers to health care.  The program, which began in the Department of Disability and Human Development in 2011, has expanded to three other Illinois universities—Northwestern, University of Chicago and Southern Illinois University—with recent funding from the Illinois Council on Developmental Disabilities.  “It’s an eye-opening experience for many of the medical students,” says Yamaki, DHD research associate professor.  The program, developed in collaboration with Maureen Gecht-Silver, associate director of medical student education in the Department of Family Medicine, is part of the family practice clerkship.  With only five to seven students each time, “it’s a very intensive interaction,” Yamaki says.           UIC Medical students talk to UCP Seguin participants about nutrition and the importance of eating fruits and vegetables. The medical students develop, then present, a session on a health-related topic for clients at UCP Seguin. This helps the students learn how to better communicate with people who have IDD.     Students learn how to interact comfortably and respectfully with people who have IDD, adjusting their communication style to use concrete examples instead of abstract concepts, avoid professional jargon, ask close-ended questions for nonverbal clients and give specific parameters for behavior change. They learn about legal rights and community services related to disability.  “One of really wonderful things is that we’re ingraining this into their foundational education, rather than ad hoc when they’re already in practice,” said research project manager Kaitlin Stober .  The students visit UCP Seguin, a community organization in Cicero that offers a variety of services to adults and children with IDD. They tour the facility and have one-on-one conversations with UCP Seguin clients.  Based on these interviews, the medical students develop an educational program on a health-related subject. Past programs have focused on topics like food portion sizes, what happens during a typical visit to the doctor, how germs are spread, and meditation to reduce stress.  In the final session, the students return to UCP Seguin to present their educational program to Seguin clients.  Since 2011, about 230 UIC medical students have been through the training. Their attitudes about people with IDD are measured by a survey taken before and after the program; results will be analyzed at the end of the funding period.  “Students who’ve completed the program say we have changed their perceptions,” Yamaki says. “This is a powerful program.”         Disability and Human Development    Back to main content           Admissions and Programs    Expand Admissions and Programs menu          Minor in Disability and Human Development    BS in Disability and Human Development    Expand BS in Disability and Human Development menu          What to Expect    Before You Apply    Applying    Expand Applying menu          Transferring from another UIC program      After You Apply      MS in Disability and Human Development    PhD in Disability Studies    Expand PhD in Disability Studies menu          What to Expect    Before You Apply    Applying    After You Apply    Faculty    Meet Our Students      Assistive Technology Certificate    Expand Assistive Technology Certificate menu          What to Expect    Applying    Faculty    Assistive Technology Certificate FAQ      Disability Ethics Certificate    Expand Disability Ethics Certificate menu          What to Expect    Applying        Institute on Disability and Human Development    Community Partners    Expand Community Partners menu          Bodies of Work      Research Centers, Clinics and Community Programs    Continuing Education and Community Training    News    Calendar    Directory    Contact              Follow Disability and Human Development      Facebook      Twitter      Instagram                         College of  Applied Health  Sciences       UI Health Logo                            Quick Links    Calendar    Directory    News    Inside AHS    Graduation      Resources    Academic Support and Achievement Program    Student Resources    Faculty and Staff Resources    Academic Calendar      Tools    myUIC    GoogleApps@UIC    Webmail    Blackboard    Nessie        Connect with AHS    Contact us    Apply Now    Give to AHS         1919 W Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60612  312-996-6695  ahsinfo@uic.edu    Social Media Accounts      Facebook      Twitter      LinkedIn      Instagram      YouTube                     UIC.edu links   UIC.edu  Academic Calendar  Athletics  Campus Directory  Disability Resources  Emergency Information  Event Calendar  Job Openings  Library  Maps  UIC News  UI Health  Veterans Affairs        © 2020 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois |  Privacy Statement    Campuses   University of Illinois System  Urbana-Champaign  Springfield
