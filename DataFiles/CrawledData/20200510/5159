This situation is particularly problematic as they are often more vulnerable to the development of secondary conditions such as obesity, pain, social isolation, deconditioning and depression due to insufficient participation in key health promoting behaviors.  We believe that investing resources in empowering people with disabilities to improve and self-manage their own health through appropriate exercise, nutrition and health behavior can have an enormous impact in improving quality of life and reducing healthcare costs.  The CHP was established in 1997 with the primary aim to identify people with disabilities who are at risk for developing numerous health complications and provide them with the knowledge and skills necessary for promoting their own independence, equal opportunity, quality of life, and longevity.  Building upon the core funding provided by the University of Illinois at Chicago, the CHP has been able to successfully compete for federal funding from the National Institutes on Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research.
