Public Policy provides excellent preparation for careers in government at all levels (federal, state, local), as well as the nonprofit sector, law, and consulting. Given the impact public policy has on medicine, engineering, technology, and other key sectors of the global economy, a minor in Public Policy provides critical knowledge for students pursuing careers in these fields.  This program focuses on the systematic analysis of public policy issues and decision processes, and includes instruction in the role of economic and political factors in public decision-making and policy formulation, microeconomic analysis of policy issues, resource allocation and decision modeling, cost/benefit analysis, statistical methods, and through a three-course specialization sequence, includes applications to specific public policy topics. Students may enter as freshmen or as transfer students from other programs or universities. Students must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00/4.00 in all course work taken at UIC and a minimum GPA of 2.50/4.00 in all course work counting toward core program requirements (see below).  Admission Requirements  New first year students interested in admission to the BA in Public Policy program must apply using the Common Application and be admitted by the Department of Public Administration, College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs. Admission is competitive, and preference is given to those applicants selected to have the best potential for academic success. See the Admission s  section for more information.  Transfer students who have completed a minimum of 24 semester hours or 36 quarter hours of transferable college course work by the time of application, and do not meet the definition of an incoming first year or readmission applicant may apply to transfer into the BA in Public Policy. While 24 semester or 36 quarter hours are the minimum number of hours required, most curricula require additional credit hours and the completion of some specific core first year courses. See the Admissions  section for additional information. See the Office of Admission Transfer Guide for more information about transfer admission requirements.  Grade Point Average  A student must earn a cumulative grade point average of 2.00/4.00 in all work taken at UIC and a cumulative grade point average of 2.50/4.00 for required courses (core program requirements) for the Public Policy degree. In addition, the combined grade point average of a student’s transfer work and work taken at UIC must be at least 2.00.
