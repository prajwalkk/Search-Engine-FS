A preadmission information session is offered weekdays (excluding campus holidays), and is followed by an optional campus tour. In addition, preadmission information sessions and campus tours are available on selected Saturdays throughout the year.  UIC Preview Days give prospective students an opportunity to tour campus, visit a residence hall, obtain information about campus housing and financial aid, and attend information sessions with academic advisors from each of UIC’s undergraduate programs.  For dates and reservations, prospective students should consult the Office of Admissions website .  Refer to the Campus Map and Travel Directions and Visitor Parking for instructions on how to reach the UIC campus or visit the UIC website for more information.  Admissions Application Procedures  All undergraduate applicants who wish to attend UIC must submit the Common Application or UIC Application online. All first year applicants must use the Common Application. Please go to the admissions website to start the application process . Applicants must also submit all supporting documents and the required nonrefundable application fee (or application fee waiver) by the appropriate deadline to ensure an application review. All credentials presented for admission become the permanent property of the university, cannot be subsequently released to the student or to another individual or institution, and may not be held for reconsideration of admission to subsequent terms.  All students should carefully read the application instructions.  For information about registration as a visitor/auditor, see the Registering and Enrolling in Courses at UIC section of the catalog.  English Language Competency Requirement for All Applicants  Minimum requirements for competence in English apply to all applicants. An applicant may establish competence in English by certifying that the following requirements have been fulfilled in a country where English is the only official/native language and in a school where English is the primary language of instruction:   Successful completion of a minimum of two academic years of full-time study at the secondary school or college level immediately prior to the proposed date of enrollment in the university.  Applicants who have a minimum of one year full-time employment in the U.S. or other country where English is the only official language. Applicants must submit a letter from their employer (on company letterhead) verifying at least 12 consecutive months of employment and describing the applicant’s English language ability.   Applicants who do not meet the above requirement may provide sufficient evidence of competence in English by achieving a minimum score on any of the following tests:   TOEFL iBT score of 80; the iBT (Internet-based Test of English as a Foreign Language) is administered by the Educational Testing Service .  a minimum IELTS score of 6.5, with subsection minimums as follows: listening 6, writing 6, reading 6, speaking 6;  PTE Academic of 54 with subscores of listening 47, writing 56, reading 51, and speaking 53.  Higher scores may be required for some programs and colleges.   Please note that higher scores may be required for some programs and colleges. This requirement may be waived by the Executive Director of Admissions and the dean of the college concerned if the applicant can provide evidence of competence in English that will clearly justify a waiver. Waivers may be justified based on standardized scores (ACT, SAT, AP, IB) on a case-by-case basis.  Undergraduate Applications and Credentials Deadlines  Students must apply online prior to the deadlines listed. Applications and credentials must be postmarked by this deadline to guarantee an admission review.  Some upper-division and health sciences programs have special deadline dates that may be earlier than those on the chart. Refer to the Office of Admissions website or the undergraduate application for current dates.   UG Application and Credentials Deadlines     Applicant Type  Fall Semester  Spring Semester     First Year—Early Action  November 1  Not Available   First Year—Regular Decision  January 15  October 1   Transfer  March 31  October 15     First Year Applicant  A first year applicant is either:   one who applies for admission while attending high school, regardless of the amount of college credit earned or  one who has graduated from high school, but has never attended a college or university.   First Year Applicant Admission Requirements  A first year applicant at UIC must complete the following:   Complete and submit the Common Application Online along with the UIC section. Printed applications will not be accepted.  Submit the $60 nonrefundable application fee or, if qualified, select an application waiver.  Current high school students must submit an official high school transcript using the Recommender process within the Common Application School Form.  Graduated applicants who have never attended another college or university must submit an official transcript showing evidence of graduation from an accredited high school or submit an official transcript along with passing scores on the General Educational Development (GED) test.  Complete the American College Test (ACT) or the College Board Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT-R). ACT and SAT test scores may be submitted electronically via the testing service or printed on official transcripts.   Homeschooled students must satisfy all of the above requirements. A homeschool transcript is acceptable if it includes:   a list of all subjects/courses attempted by year;  grades or examination results received (both passing and failing);  maximum and minimum grades obtainable; and  number of units earned.   International applicants must also display evidence of English competency and submit financial certification.  Admission is competitive, and preference is given to those applicants selected to have the best potential for academic success at UIC.  Transfer Applicant  A transfer applicant is one who:   has completed a minimum of 24 semester or 36 quarter hours of transferable college classroom credit by the time of application and  does not meet the definition of a first year applicant or a readmission applicant.   While 24 semester or 36 quarter hours are the minimum number of hours required, some curricula require additional credit hours and/or the completion of specific core courses. For specific requirements in each curriculum , consult the admissions website.    Evaluation of Transfer Work for Undergraduate Admission and Transfer Credit   Transfer work a is evaluated for admission purposes and considered for credit. The university evaluates transfer work completed at institutions accredited by a regional or national accrediting organization recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) , including institutions under candidacy status. Foreign institutions must be recognized by the ministry of education in the home country or an equivalent government authority.  To be eligible for admission and credit, transfer work must be similar in nature, level, and content to courses in the undergraduate curriculum and/or applicable to an undergraduate academic program. Other transfer work that is deemed nontransferable (such as continuing education courses, graduate-level courses, and courses that are remedial, technical, vocational, or doctrinal in nature as determined by the campus) are not used in admission decisions regardless of the institution’s accreditation.  Credit for transfer courses is either applied as direct equivalents with university courses or applied to a degree in a manner determined by the department and college. Determining how transfer credit is applied varies by campus depending on the process established to implement university policy.  The precise amount of transfer credit awarded and that is applicable toward a particular degree is determined by or in consultation with the university college and department concerned.   a “Transfer work” and “transfer courses” are used interchangeably in this policy. Regardless of the term, this policy applies to transfer work not in the form of courses, such as credit for military service and credit earned through testing and experiential learning. Transfer work not in the form of courses is evaluated for transfer per the terms of this policy.  Transfer Student Admission Requirements   Complete and submit the UIC Application . Printed applications are not accepted.  Submit the $60 nonrefundable application fee or, if qualified, select an application waiver.  To be considered for admission, a transfer applicant must submit evidence of having achieved a minimum transfer grade point average of 2.50/4.00 or 3.50/5.00 on the basis of all transferable work attempted at the time of application. However, most colleges and departments require a higher minimum grade point average and the completion of specific prerequisite courses. For detailed information on the requirements for each college , consult the Undergraduate Admissions website.  For admission purposes, transfer grades for all baccalaureate-oriented course work attempted and accepted are used in computing the transfer student’s average. However, a particular UIC college or school may not accept all courses toward degree requirements.  When a course is repeated the grade point average is computed using both grades and all hours for the course. However, credit for the course is only awarded once.  Incomplete grades more than one year old are considered as failing grades in computing the grade point average.  Only course work that is similar in nature, content, and level to that offered by UIC is acceptable.  Technical, vocational, developmental, and remedial course work generally is not transferable.  Courses from other postsecondary institutions must have been completed at the appropriate level to be transferable.  Credit for nontraditional experiential prior learning is not transferable.  Applicants enrolled in another college at the time they plan to apply to UIC should request a transcript from their current institution including a list of the courses they are taking at the beginning of the last term they are enrolled. (Fall applicants currently attending a quarter-based school should apply at the beginning of their winter term.) A final transcript should be sent to UIC as soon as possible after the final term is completed.   International applicants must satisfy additional requirements to be considered for admission. Information pertaining to the additional requirements is available in the following section titled International Applicant.  Admission is competitive, and preference is given to those applicants selected to have the best potential for academic success at UIC.  Illinois Articulation Initiative  The Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI) is a statewide agreement that allows transfer of the completed IAI General Education Core Curriculum (GECC) between participating Illinois institutions. Successful completion of the GECC at any participating college or university in Illinois assures students that general education requirements for the baccalaureate degree have been satisfied. The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is a participating university. At UIC, students attain junior standing upon the completion of 60 credit hours. Completion of an Associate of Arts or Associate of Science degree typically requires an earned credit total beyond 60 hours. Please note that some test credit may not be transferable to UIC.  IAI policies, including GECC requirements, course codes and course descriptions, are presented on the IAI website and UIC’s implementation requirements are published below. Students who transfer out of UIC will be held to the requirements of their transfer institution.  Eligibility   Only transfer students entering UIC for the first time are eligible for IAI consideration. IAI policies do not apply to students who are readmitted to UIC or students who take courses elsewhere after enrolling at UIC.  New transfer students who enter UIC with the GECC completed will be considered to have completed UIC’s General Education requirements as defined in the General Education section of the catalog. However, additional General Education requirements that have been approved for specific UIC colleges may still be required.  New transfer students with 30 hours of accepted transfer work who have not completed the GECC may consult with a college advisor to review options for completing General Education requirements. Depending on the number of remaining courses required, a student may be allowed the option of completing either UIC’s General Education program or the GECC.   Note: The GECC option is made available only when completion of the GECC requirements calls for at least two fewer courses than would be needed to complete UIC’s General Education requirements.  For students who complete the GECC prior to UIC enrollment New transfer students who enter UIC with the GECC completed must meet with a college advisor to ensure that UIC General Education requirements are marked as fulfilled in the university’s degree audit system. To assist with first-semester course selection at UIC, students should bring a copy of a community college or participating Illinois university transcript that includes a statement showing completion of the IAI GECC to the Transfer Orientation Program.  For students eligible to complete the GECC at UIC   All accepted transfer courses completed prior to enrollment at UIC that are identified on the IAI website with a corresponding GECC course code will be used to satisfy GECC requirements.  GECC may be completed by enrolling in approved IAI courses at UIC.  UIC policies on Credit by Examination (ACT/SAT, AP, IB, and CLEP) in the Academic Standing section of the catalog will be used to determine credit used to satisfy GECC requirements. UIC will not award transfer course credit based on another institution’s evaluation of test results.  If a student satisfactorily fulfills the course requirements of a GECC area but earns fewer hours than required, the remaining hours for that area may be waived by the college dean. However, students must complete a minimum of 12 courses, a minimum of 37 hours, and the minimum number of courses required in each area of the GECC.  Transfer credit from a nonparticipating IAI institution is not acceptable to meet GECC requirements.   UIC’s GECC Courses UIC courses approved for the IAI General Education Core Curriculum are listed officially on the IAI website .  Intercampus Transfer Applicant  Undergraduate intercampus transfers among the University of Illinois at Chicago, at Springfield, and at Urbana-Champaign may be admitted to another campus provided:   they meet the requirements of the program,  there is space available in the program, and  they submit the application and credentials by the application deadline.   Students who are currently enrolled and who are applying to one of the other campuses for the immediately succeeding semester do not pay an application fee. “Immediately succeeding semester” may mean either the spring semester if the applicant completed the fall semester at the other campus, or it may mean the summer or fall term, provided the applicant completed the spring semester at the other campus.  Readmission Applicant  Readmission applicants are former UIC students who were registered as degree-seeking undergraduates and who left the university for two or more semesters in succession (summer session excluded). Readmission applicants are considered for readmission on the basis of their status at the time they left the university, any college work they have completed elsewhere since their last attendance at the university, and the availability of space in the chosen program. Degree-seeking readmission applicants do not pay the application fee.  Former UIC students who left the university on academic dismissal status, regardless of whether they have attended another collegiate institution in the interval, must submit a petition with an application when they apply for readmission. Admission is granted upon approval of the dean of the college concerned and of the managing director of admissions.  Former students who left the university on probation, or who left UIC on clear status but have attended another collegiate institution where they have earned an academic GPA below 2.00/4.00, may be readmitted to the university only with a petition approved by the dean of the college concerned.  A former UIC student who was dismissed for disciplinary reasons must submit a petition to the managing director of admissions, who will forward it to the appropriate committee.  Applicants for readmission to any of the health professional programs should contact the program or department for instructions.  Nondegree Applicant  Students who do not presently wish to enroll in a degree program at UIC, but who wish to take courses for credit may apply for nondegree status. During the fall and spring semesters, acceptance of a student in nondegree status is at the discretion of the dean of the college to which the student is applying. Nondegree applicants for fall and spring semesters must meet all regular admission requirements and submit a nondegree petition before being approved to apply. A complete application is then required for review.  Nondegree students are not eligible for most financial aid. Priority in admission and registration is given to degree students.  Summer Session Only Applicant  A student who wishes to take undergraduate courses at UIC during the summer only and who does not intend to continue at UIC in the fall may apply as a Summer Session Only student. Typical Summer Session Only students include students enrolled in degree programs at other colleges or universities who are in the Chicago area for the summer. Individuals who have already completed undergraduate degrees but need to take undergraduate-level courses to fill deficiencies in preparation for advanced study may also apply as Summer Session Only students.  Prospective Summer Session Only students must complete a Summer Session Only Application .  Students who wish to attend UIC in the summer and continue in the fall or spring semester need to submit a Summer Session Only application for the summer and the Common Application and UIC Supplement, along with providing the required credentials, for the later term. Each application must be submitted by the appropriate deadline for the specific term of admission.  International Applicant  An international applicant is a person who is a citizen or permanent resident of a country or political area other than the United States and who has a residence outside the United States to which he or she expects to return, and either is, or proposes to be, a temporary alien in the United States for educational purposes.  The university is authorized under federal law to enroll academically qualified nonimmigrant alien students.  International students who will need to apply for F-1 or J-1 immigration status must register as full-time, degree-seeking students and are not eligible for financial aid.  English Language Competency Requirements  See the earlier section on English Language Competency Requirement for All Applicants .  Financial Resources Requirement  In order for international students to enter or remain in the United States for educational purposes, evidence of adequate financial resources must be provided before visa documents can be issued. Acceptable documentation of adequate financial resources includes a UIC Declaration and Certification of Finances or U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Affidavit of Support. Either of these documents must be accompanied by a certified letter from a bank showing evidence of adequate funds in U.S. dollars. The University of Illinois at Chicago does not offer scholarships or other types of financial assistance to international undergraduate students.  Guaranteed Professional Program Admissions  The Guaranteed Professional Program Admissions (GPPA) is one of UIC’s programs for academically talented students. Each fall, up to 150 motivated and highly qualified entering freshmen can be admitted to UIC with admission guaranteed to one of the following professional or graduate programs if undergraduate course and performance criteria are met:   Applied Health Sciences  Biomedical Visualization  Health Information Management  Nutrition  Kinesiology  Occupational Therapy  Physical Therapy    Business  Accounting  Management Information Systems    Dentistry  Education  Engineering  Law  Medicine  Nursing  Pharmacy  Public Health   Admission to GPPA is competitive, based on each professional program’s requirements for ACT or SAT score, high school percentile rank, preparatory course work, and other criteria. The most successful applicants will have at least a minimum ACT score of 28 or an SAT-I score of 1240 and a high school rank in the top 15% if the high school ranks.  To be considered for GPPA, students must complete the UIC GPPA section when completing the UIC Supplement on the Common Application website. Applicants are also required to submit two letters of recommendation prior to the appropriate deadline. Applications are accepted from August 1 through November 1. All GPPA decisions will be announced in early April.  To request more information, consult the GPPA website . Application and program information questions can be directed to (312) 355-2477 or gppauic@uic.edu .  Honors College  The UIC Honors College enhances opportunities for intellectual challenge and leadership by fostering a community of academic excellence, connecting outstanding undergraduate students with premier faculty mentors and promoting scholarly engagement. By bringing together exceptional undergraduate students, faculty, and staff, the Honors College provides an environment for advanced intellectual growth and a foundation for life-long learning.  First year applicants, transfer students, or currently enrolled UIC students may apply to the Honors College. Honors College students may pursue any undergraduate major.  First year applicants who have strong academic records as well as extracurricular or leadership experience are encouraged to apply. Transfer students who have earned a minimum 3.40/4.00 grade point average are also encouraged to apply to the Honors College, as well as current UIC students who have earned a minimum 3.40/4.00 UIC grade point average and have at least three semesters left before graduation.  For specific instructions on how to apply please consult the Honors College website .  Alternative Sources of Credit  Credit Through ACT or SAT  See Credit by Examination in the Academic Standing section of the catalog.  Credit for Military Service  Completion of not less than six months of extended duty in any branch of the armed forces of the United States entitles an applicant to four semester hours in basic military science. These four hours will not be used in determining grade point average for transfer admission. Some colleges may limit or not allow credit in basic military science to count toward the degree. Refer to the sections for the individual colleges in this catalog for details.  Credit at the baccalaureate level will not be issued for course work from the American Council on Education Military Guide. Colleges will work with students to obtain proficiency credit for associated course work.  Courses successfully completed at a regionally or nationally accredited post-secondary institution a , taken while the student was in service, will be reviewed for transferability after an offer of admission. It is the enrolled student’s responsibility to have transcripts from all institutions attended sent directly to the Office of Admissions. Students who transfer course work may anticipate some loss of credit. This might require more time to complete the degree than had been originally planned. When the loss of credit occurs, it does not imply a negative evaluation of a student’s transfer work but rather a lack of appropriateness for the programs of the college. Attendance at orientation is strongly encouraged as an individualized assessment of progress-to-degree and appropriate course selection will be reviewed.  a The university evaluates transfer work completed at institutions accredited by a regional or national accrediting organization recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) , including institutions under candidacy status.
