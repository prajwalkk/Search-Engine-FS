This year, UIC’s student chapter of American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) will have the added pressure of hosting the three-day event. The conference is slated for April 19 to 21 in Chicago.  The GLSC is comprised of 18 regional universities, which is made up of schools from northern and central Illinois, southern Wisconsin, and Indiana, and it is one of the largest regions based on number of schools.  “This will be a huge undertaking; we are expecting to host about 550 participants,” said Diana Briones, president of ASCE UIC. The schools will compete in a series of Civil Engineering-based competitions and network with other students and professionals.  In 2017, the UIC team won two the eight competitions and made significant advances in the highly-competitive Concrete Canoe and Steel Bridge competitions in 2017.  The ASCE is an engineering society devoted to advancing technologies, encouraging lifelong learning, promoting professionalism and the civil engineering profession, developing civil engineering leaders, and advocating infrastructure and environmental stewardship.
