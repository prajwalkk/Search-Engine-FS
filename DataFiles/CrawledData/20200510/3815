Please share this as needed with your faculty investigators, research staff and students.  As always, thank you for your leadership.  Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research UPDATE – March 20, 2020, 5:25pm  The OVCR would like to call your attention to three updates today.  The Biologic Resources Laboratory (BRL), following Governor Pritzker’s ‘stay at home’ order starting on Saturday at 5:00pm until April 7 th , recommends that Principal Investigators designate lab members who will come to campus for routine monitoring and ongoing management of their animals.  The Office for the Protection of Research Subjects (OPRS) has updated their FAQs page to respond to questions regarding HIPAA-approved tools to modify/move in-person research encounters to a remote or video platform. This information is useful for continuing human subjects research studies while reducing risks to both our study participants and our researchers.  Please also visit the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) for updated information including the Joint Letter from the APLU, AAU, AAMC and ACE to our leaders in Congress.
