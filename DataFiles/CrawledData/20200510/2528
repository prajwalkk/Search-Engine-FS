The project represents a rare opportunity to design a product with no precedents and to create an urban icon designed to look familiar in the city landscape while providing an innovative function. The award-winning result, JuicePole, is a public electric vehicle charger designed as a piece of urban furniture that integrates within the streetscape. The iconic shape of JuicePole is the simple, familiar form of a pure cylinder. The size of the charging station is miniaturized, to allow its top to fit below the line of sight, reducing the visual presence on the street.
