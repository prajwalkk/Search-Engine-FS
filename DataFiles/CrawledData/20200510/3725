Important note for Engineering Students: Because of the substantial overlap in degree requirements, Computer Science majors in the Engineering College are not allowed to minor in Mathematical Computer Science.  All Engineering students may minor in Mathetmatics, but have additional special requirements for completing the minor.  See below for more details on each minor.      Minor in Mathematics         Minor in Mathematics   Mathematics is the abstract study of number, pattern, quantity, systems, and space, as well as the language of science and all fields in which patterns and systematic processes are analyzed. Taking courses in the mathematical sciences helps students learn to conceptualize abstract structures and provides them with the framework and analytical tools necessary for understanding our technology-based and data-intensive society. Both the MATH major and minor sequences help prepare students for a wide range of opportunities in the natural sciences, social sciences, business, finance, and government; for professional schools, such as law school; and for almost any job or career in which strong analytical and communication skills are valued.  The minor requirements are listed in the undergraduate catalog.  Important Information for Engineering Students  Due to substantial duplication of courses and/or content in the major and minor, Engineering students who minor in MATH must take at least two courses that are not already required for their Engineering major.  Students in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering who are planning to minor in MATH must observe the two-course rule:   The student must take two more MSCS courses beyond what is already required for the Engineering curriculum; and  5 of the 8 hours beyond MATH 210 must be in the MATH rubric. Once this rule has been met, the student can use any 200-level or higher MSCS class toward the minor.   Computer Engineering Major/MATH Minor   MATH 180, 181, 210, 220  Plus one from MATH 310, 320, or MCS 471  Plus two additional 200-level or higher MSCS classes   Electrical Engineering Major/MATH Minor   MATH 180, 181, 210, 220  Plus one from MATH 310, STAT 381, STAT 401, MATH 410, MATH 417, MCS 471, or MATH 481  Plus two additional 200-level or higher MSCS classes   Other Engineering Majors (BioE, ChemE, C&ME, MechE, IndE)/MATH Minor   Math 180, 181, 210, 220  Plus two more MSCS courses: one course must be in the MATH rubric, and the other course can be any 200-level or higher MSCS class     Undergraduate catalog entry          Minor in Mathematical Computer Science         Minor in Mathematical Computer Science   The MCS curriculum fosters the development of logical and analytical thinking and is designed to provide a basic foundation for a career in the forefront of computing. Emphasis is given to the mathematical theory of computer science and computational methods but includes both practical and theoretical aspects of computer science.  Minor requirements are listed in the undergraduate catalog .   Important Information for Engineering Students   Students majoring in Computer Science may not minor in MCS due to duplication of courses and/or content.  Other Engineering majors who wish to minor in MCS should follow the course requirements as listed in the undergraduate catalog.
