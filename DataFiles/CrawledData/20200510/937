My tutor was very down-to-earth and gave me much better feedback than my professor and classmates. I feel more confident on finishing up my paper after our session here than weeks of class. 10/10 will come back if I have another paper.”   Read more testimonials from students who've used the Writing Center          Links           Student FAQs             Instructor FAQs             FAQs about online tutoring             Contact Us             Other Tutoring Resources                        UIC Logo        Writing Center       Contact   703 S Morgan, Chicago, IL 60607  Phone: 312-413-2206  wconlinehelp@gmail.com        Social Media Accounts           Conversations at the Writing Center                        UIC.edu links   UIC.edu  Academic Calendar  Athletics  Campus Directory  Disability Resources  Emergency Information  Event Calendar  Job Openings  Library  Maps  UIC Safe Mobile App  UIC Today  UI Health  Veterans Affairs        Powered by Red 2.38.0  © 2020 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois |  Privacy Statement    Campuses   University of Illinois System  Urbana-Champaign  Springfield      Cookie Settings
