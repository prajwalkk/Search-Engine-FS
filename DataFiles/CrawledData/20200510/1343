With so many things changing on an almost daily basis, you have risen to the challenge of transitioning to a digital campus and workplace so we can stem the spread of the virus at UIC and beyond. We are grateful for all you have done and are continuing to do.  In order to coincide with Governor Pritzker’s extension of the Stay at Home Order, which will last until April 30, UIC is immediately suspending payroll deduction of university parking fees for the month of April.  As a result, you will not see any parking charges on your next paycheck. Moving forward, we will be sure to provide you with campus parking updates as they become available.  If you have questions or need more information, please email parking@uic.edu .  Thank you again for all you are doing to support UIC’s mission and protect the health and safety of our university community.  Sincerely,  John Coronado Vice Chancellor for Administrative Services     Contact   UIC News staff   uicnews-staff@uic.edu     Categories   Coronavirus , Official Communications , VC Admin Services officials    Topics  coronavirus , COVID-19 , novel coronavirus              UIC Logo        Today      Contact  Office of Public and Government Affairs 601 S.
