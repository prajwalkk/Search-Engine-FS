From Project HEAL, which has increased the number of Chicagoans who know their HIV status, to research investigating the efficacy of an app to improve HIV medication adherence among gay black men, UIC researchers are making a real impact on reducing the unintended spread of HIV.  By partnering with the Chicago Park District to conduct same-day water testing that park officials use to guide swim advisories that warn swimmers of dangerous bacteria levels, UIC directly protects the health of thousands of beachgoers and swimmers every summer. The program has expanded to include 20 Chicago beaches.  Researchers in UIC’s CDC-funded Illinois Prevention Research Center, housed in the UIC School of Public, conduct research that will help guide public health policies and environmental changes aimed at improving nutrition, physical activity, and tobacco avoidance to reduce chronic disease risk — and to diminish disparities among population groups in these health behaviors and outcomes.  Their work will look at how numerous social determinants of health, including access to healthy food, transportation and the availability of places for recreation and exercise impact health.  The Center for Health Equity Research Chicago is a National Institutes of Health-funded Center of Excellence, based out of the University of Illinois Cancer Center and the UIC School of Public Health and in collaboration with the University of Chicago Medicine, dedicated to researching how various social structures and determinants contribute to the health of marginalized groups.  Co-led by UIC reserachers, the Chicago Center for Health and Environment promotes multidisciplinary environmental health research among clinician, laboratory and population scientists in Chicago to evaluate and ultimately reduce environmental health-related disparities among residents of the region and beyond.
