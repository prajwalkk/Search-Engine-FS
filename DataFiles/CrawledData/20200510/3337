DO CLINICAL REFRACTIONS RESULT IN BEST VISUAL ACUITY  THE MANDELBAUM EFFECT
MAY NOT BE DUE TO INVOLUNTARY MIS-ACCOMMODATION  G.A. Gleason 1 and
Robert V. Kenyon 2  Armstrong Laboratory, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 1 ;
University of Illinois at Chicago 2 .  Purpose  Far objects
appear blurred when viewed through a screen mesh (Mandelbaum effect) presumably
because accommodation is biased towards the near screen. Owens reported
this bias is maximum when the screen is near the dark focus point. We studied
dynamic accommodation while a far target is viewed and an intervening screen
is added.  Methods  The Mandelbaum
effect was demonstrated to five untrained emmetropic subjects (age = 22
± 2). Then, eye focus was continuously measured (40Hz) with an infrared
optometer as subjects monocularly viewed a 20/70 Snellen E on a eye chart
located 26 feet away. Each 30-second trial had four consecutive viewing
conditions: (1) look at E directly (baseline), (2) look at E through screen,
(3) look at screen, and (4) look at E through screen again. In separate
trials, the screen was at the distance of maximum blur (124 cm ±
13), or 40 cm. Dark focus was also measured.  Results (1) Eye focus
did not change from baseline with screen addition. (2) Eye focus
was near veridical when attention was directed to the screen. (3) Eye focus returned to baseline when attention was redirected to the far
E. All subjects reported blur of the far E while viewing through the screen.
The screen distance of maximum blur was not predicted by dark focus.  Conclusion  This objective
experiment, along with some subjective observations, indicate the Mandelbaum
effect is not likely due to involuntary mis-accommodation.  Owens, D.A. (1979). J. Opt. Soc. Am., 69 , 646-652    Lt Col Gerald A Gleason  Human Engineering Division  Armstrong Laboratory  2255 H.
