The candidate must also maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.50/4.00 and a minimum GPA of 3.00/4.00 in education courses. Students must receive a grade of C or higher in all professional education and content-area coursework required for licensure and endorsement.  The teaching license is not automatically awarded upon successful completion of licensure and degree requirements. Before the license is issued, the candidate must file an application for the Illinois teaching license with the Council on Teacher Education. The candidate must also pass a series of examinations required by the Illinois State Board of Education. The Basic Skills Test must be passed prior to applying for candidacy with the Council on Teacher Education. The Content Area Test must be passed before the candidate is allowed to student teach. The edTPA must be passed prior to licensure. For information on application procedures, contact the Council on Teacher Education located at 1333 S. Halsted St., Suite 205. See the Council on Teacher Education section of the catalog. For detailed information concerning degree and state teacher licensure requirements, see the Program Guide for Teacher Education in Mathematics , available from the secondary education coordinator of the Office of Mathematics and Computer Education.

Prerequisites  To declare the Teaching of Mathematics curriculum, students need a B or better in MATH 180 or a cumulative math GPA of 2.5 or higher in all courses from MATH 180 and up.  There are specific GPA requirements to remain in good standing and remain eligible for candidacy in each of the programs.  Timeline  Most “Teaching of…” curriculum students enrolled full-time should be able to complete their undergraduate course work and licensure requirements in four years, if they declare within their first four semesters. If a student does not make this decision until their junior year (5th semester or later), pursuit of the curriculum and teaching licensure will result in an extended undergraduate career. Model plans are available for transfer students and those beginning at UIC and declaring early; these are only to serve as an example for students considering the curriculum. Students should meet with the advisor in their department for personalized recommendations and timelines.  Education Courses  All Secondary Education curriculum students must take the following Education courses: ED 200 , ED 210 , SPED 410 , and ED 425 . Teaching of History and Math must also take CI 414 . Students should meet with their department advisors to determine appropriate course sequence. Non-Education students may only take limited 100-level Education courses.  Curriculum vs. Licensure  Simply completing the requirements for a “Teaching of…” curriculum, does not guarantee licensure. Students should be completing licensure requirements in conjunction with meeting curriculum and college graduation requirements. There are several steps in the licensure process, so it is imperative that a student meet with their program advisor to remain on track.
