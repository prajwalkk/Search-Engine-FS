This interim appointment will allow for the continued transition in leadership following the retirement of Dean Mary Case. Dr. Colley will hold this interim role while continuing as Dean of the Graduate College until the conclusion of a national search for a permanent University Librarian and Dean of Libraries.  That search will get underway this summer.  I hope you will join me in thanking Dean Case for her many years of exemplary leadership, which we will celebrate at a later date, and in supporting Dr. Colley in her new role.  Sincerely,  Susan Poser Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs  For more information, please contact: Kelcie O’Shea  kgauen3@uic.edu     Contact   UIC News staff   uicnews-staff@uic.edu     Categories   Official Communications , Provost officials                UIC Logo        Today      Contact  Office of Public and Government Affairs 601 S.
