The college provides limited financial aid to help ensure the student body is academically talented and diverse. To the extent possible, the College helps students become aware of external support that will help them finance their graduate education.  Opportunities for financial aid generally fall into categories:   Student loans and work study are administered by the UIC Office of Student Financial Aid.  Awards, and Assistantships are administered by the JACSW Office of Admissions and Financial Aid via the Scholarship and Award Program (SnAP).   Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) All eligible United States citizens and permanent residents are encouraged to submit an online FASFA application before the deadline date. (link to FASFA here)  International students are not eligible to submit the online FAFSA. They are required to submit the “Declaration and Certificate of Finances” form to UIC during the application process.  Scholarship and Awards (SnAP)  SnAP is the campus wide scholarship management system that is used for scholarships/awards for UIC and JACSW. New and continuing students use this portal to view and apply for scholarships.  New students will be given access and instructions from the JACSW Office of Admissions and Financial Aid via email after the confirmation of their attendance and once the portal is available to receive applications.  Continuing students will be given access and instructions via email from the Office of Academic Affairs and Student Services once the portal is available to receive applications.  Scholarships/awards are dependent on available funding and awarded based on a variety of criteria (financial need, special situations/circumstances, cost of attending, student loan debt, donor’s specific criteria)  Assistantships  JACSW has a very limited number of teaching/graduate assistantships and are usually related to specific concentrations.
