When you register for summer session classes you will be enrolled automatically in CampusCare for the summer. There is no enrollment form to complete. Eligible students include all registered degree and non-degree Undergraduate, Graduate, and Health Professional students.  CampusCare benefits include:   Physician, hospital and emergency room services  Discounted vision and dental program  Behavioral health services  Prescription drug coverage   Dates of Coverage  CampusCare coverage begins on Monday, May 18, 2020 for students who register for any summer courses before Monday, June 1, 2020. If you register for courses on or after June 1 your coverage will begin on the date you register. To avoid problems with access to coverage, the CampusCare office advises you to register for courses before May 18. Summer coverage ends on August 15, 2020.  Student Health Insurance Fee  The CampusCare Student Health Insurance fee is one of several fees listed on your student account. The fee for the 2020 Summer Session is $445 for a student.  Note that the Student Health Insurance fee is different from the Student Health Services fee, which is a mandatory fee (cannot be waived). Please check the explanation of tuition and fees for more information about services covered by this fee.  Information about waiving the CampusCare Student Health Insurance benefit if you have comparable insurance or reinstating this benefit is available on the CampusCare Waivers and Reinstatement Forms web page .
