Because of this, we’re facing new and increasingly complex ethical questions about disability.  The disability experience is complex, and brings up issues that need deep consideration and expanded perspectives.  What is Disability Ethics? Disability ethics is an interdisciplinary approach to examining, analyzing, and reaching decisions about ethical dilemmas about life with disability. It addresses many of the same issues that bioethics addresses, and expands the focus beyond medical issues. It includes legal, policy and social justice issues that affect daily living for people with disabilities.      Our program prepares you to be a leader in your field    Understand disability as a multi-dimensional entity, including a critical analysis of disability at personal, social, cultural, and policy levels  Identify and critique the basic theories and approaches of bioethics  Recognize the different perspectives and roles of various stakeholders in contemporary ethical debates involving people with disabilities  Understand and articulate how the experience and values of living with disability can inform major bioethical controversies  Apply various ethical principles to everyday situations facing people with disabilities  Develop independent scholarship that critically addresses current issues in disability ethics       Connect with us       Request info       Arrange a visit       Apply now        Your career   With a certificate in disability ethics, you’ll advance your ability to think deeply and progressively about society’s ethical responsibilities toward underrepresented communities.
