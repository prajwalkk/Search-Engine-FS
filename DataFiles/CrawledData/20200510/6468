My training prepared me to be a nurse leader and gave me the confidence to succeed in such a high-stress unit.”    Noor Bader, RN, Advocate Christ Medical Center | BSN '17          “My peers were some of the most brilliant, motivated people I have ever met. Nursing school is hard; your peers make it easier in a lot of ways. Study group is the key, and having people to unwind with helps you keep going.”    Thomas McClure, RN, Memorial Medical Center | BSN '18          Meet some UIC BSN students      Three UIC Nursing campuses offer the BSN program        Chicago          Springfield          Urbana           Take the next step        Check icon        Apply now        Calendar icon        Attend an info session        Envelope icon         Ask a specific question        Matrix icon                Request general information          Contact the director   Need to reach the director of the traditional BSN program?
