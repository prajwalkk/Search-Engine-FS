If you’re not certain what industrial engineering is or what you can do with a degree in it, don’t worry—you’re not alone. Almost all of our incoming undergraduates in IE are delving into this fascinating area for the first time. The page linked below will give you a helpful overview of this field and all its advantages.   Get to know IE         IE major intro      Industrial engineers find ways to make complex processes and systems work better. They help operations to run more efficiently and more safely, leading to improvements in the products we use every day, people’s jobs, and human satisfaction.  As an industrial engineer, you might design and implement better ways of doing things or making things. You might find ways to improve the value or profit of goods that we use every day. You also could oversee project management, devise improvements to manufacturing plants and factories, or harness the power of data to imaging the next generation of processes.  If you’ve ever looked at something and said to yourself, “I see a smarter way they could do this,” you could have the makings of a great industrial engineer.       Industrial Engineering Major Requirements   Industrial engineering majors complete coursework in four categories:   Nonengineering and general education courses: Nonengineering and general education courses provide a foundation in math and science and will make you a well-informed graduate in disciplines outside of industrial engineering. You will take 56 credit hours in this category, including math, management, statistics, and a range of “chart-your-own-path” classes in areas such as Understanding the Past and Understanding the Creative Arts. For details on general education requirements, please see the course catalog .  Required engineering courses: Students earn 63 credit hours from engineering courses that all IE majors must take. These courses—including Manufacturing Process Principles, Work Productivity Analysis, and Quality Control and Reliability—introduce you to the field. More information is available in the course catalog .  Technical electives: IE majors complete 6 credit hours from courses that interest them most and will prepare them for the specific careers or research they have in mind. Possibilities include Introduction to Computer-Aided Design, Engineering Dynamics, an undergraduate research course, and more (see the course catalog for details).  Free elective: The final 3 credit hours of the IE major come from one or more electives outside the industrial engineering rubric, based on your choice.

These are called our program educational objectives . For the industrial engineering major, they are:   To adeptly apply analytical, experimental, and computer tools in design and performance improvement of manufacturing and service systems.  To effectively pursue ethically responsible professional growth through continued learning and by taking on different roles in multidisciplinary teams (i.e., to become better engineers, both technically and in dealing with others).  To work successfully in many different situations and with many different kinds of people, and to adapt to changes in the workplace and in the world (i.e., to be engineers who embrace diversity and change).        Student Outcomes: IE Major   Another part of the ABET accreditation process requires the department to identify the specific knowledge and skills that students are intended to have when they complete their undergraduate education. These are called student outcomes .  Students graduating from the industrial engineering program at UIC will have:   an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics.  an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors.  an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences.  an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts.  an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives.  an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions.  an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.   In the 2019-2020 academic year, 93 students were enrolled at UIC Engineering as industrial engineering majors across all class years. The department graduated 26 industrial engineering majors in the academic year ending May 2019.      Apply to UIC!
