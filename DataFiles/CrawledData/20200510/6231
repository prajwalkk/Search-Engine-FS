Restorative Dentistry                    Visiting Dentist Non-Degree Program    The Visiting Dentist Program in the Department of Pediatric Dentistry is a non-degree full time program (40 hrs/week) for dental professionals from around the world who wish to broaden their knowledge of pediatric dentistry through participation in the Department’s didactic, clinical and research activities. The clinical activities are observational in nature; no hands-on experience with patients is offered. The program varies from 1 week to 6 months in length, determined by the availability of both the applicant and the Department of Pediatric Dentistry. Applications are open year-round.  Program Description  Students will enjoy a rich and unique cultural environment due to the diverse population the Department of Pediatric Dentistry serves and the different backgrounds of the faculty, residents and dental students. They will be able to interact on a daily basis with a renowned pediatric dental faculty and to participate in the educational activities being offered at the time of the visit in the certificate program in pediatric dentistry (graduate level). Lectures, seminars, case presentations and discussions focus on review of classic and contemporary articles, clinical care options, preventive strategies and research related to oral health for children and adolescents with and without special health care needs. Students will be able to put into practice what they have learned in the classroom by interacting with faculty and residents in the clinic, as they observe delivery of dental care to pediatric patients every day. Students are expected to attend and participate full-time in the courses and in the clinic, including presentations and course examinations. They will not be able to audit Master’s degree level classes, only Certificate courses offered by the Department, which vary by semester and by year.  SUMMER * Child Development * Orthodontics * Principles and Methods of Dental Research * Dental Practice in the US-cultural differences * Pediatric Dentistry Clinic  FALL * Orthodontics * Principles and Methods of Dental Research * Behavior Management * Pulp Therapy * Contemporary Issues in Pediatric Dentistry * Pediatric Dentistry Clinic  WINTER/SPRING * Advocacy in Pediatric Dentistry * Dental and Oral Care for the Medically Compromised Pediatric Patient * Dental Practice Management * Journal Club * Dental and Orofacial Trauma * Infant Oral Health and Prevention * Pediatric Dentistry Clinic  Observation of clinical care of patients, which is directly related to the topics covered in the coursework, will be done in the newly renovated, state-of-the-art graduate clinic. Clinical care may include the use of nitrous oxide, conscious sedation, and general anesthesia. In addition to observing the pediatric dental faculty and students, students may also have the opportunity to interact with other dental specialists who participate actively in the delivery of care to our patients.  Objectives  1. To acquire fundamental knowledge and skills in pediatric dentistry through didactic instruction followed by observation of laboratory and clinical procedures in the Department of Pediatric Dentistry.  2. To familiarize the foreign-trained dentist with the rigor of an advanced non-degree CE certificate program in Pediatric Dentistry.  Admission to and participation in this program do not guarantee acceptance into Graduate Degree Program in Pediatric Dentistry.  Program Fee and Other Expenses  In addition to the program fee (see table below), students are responsible for housing, food, and medical/dental insurance fees as well as for visa, travel and personal expenses. Neither the College of Dentistry nor the Department of Pediatric Dentistry will assist participants with travel or living expenses, or help secure outside funding. For visa purposes, students must be able to show that they can meet the minimum support requirements for themselves and their dependents.  $2,000/week $6,000/1 month $20,000/three months $35,000/six months   After notification of acceptance into the program, fifty percent (50%) of the non-refundable rate is required within seven (7) days.
