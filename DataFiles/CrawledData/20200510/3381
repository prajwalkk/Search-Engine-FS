Each week we select a paper which covers system issues, security issues or any other interesting topics from various conferences or journals. We will read around 4 papers on each theme. The people attend the seminar need to read the paper in advance. At the beginning of the seminar, a person gives a short summary of the paper first, then followed by the discussion including all attendees.
