The Task Force is charged with (1) recommending the classes that will be taught on-campus and those that will be taught remotely in Fall 2020; (2) distinguishing the classes that should be taught asynchronously online and those that may be taught synchronously remotely, and recommending resources to be provided to faculty to convert classes to these platforms; and (3) collecting data on the student perspective.  The Task Force is meeting regularly and will continue to do so for as long as needed.  The planning does not apply to the Colleges of Dentistry, Law, Medicine, or Pharmacy. These colleges do have representatives participating on the committee as observers.
