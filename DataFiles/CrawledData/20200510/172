ACM@UIC members engage in computing-related social and educational activities. Additionally, members are encouraged to provide computing resources and assistance to members and non-members alike. Above all, the driving force behind ACM@UIC is its students' insatiable desire to understand and contribute to the computing technology around us. It is this desire which drives us to excel and keeps this organization fun.   ACM@UIC functions as a bridge between the CS department and its students, providing tutoring and assistance to everyone taking CS courses. We host and participate in events which help keep the UIC techie community close, including LAN parties, lectures by guest speakers, the ICPC programming competition, and the Flourish open source conference. We also have a wonderful office in SEL 2264 where everyone is welcome to hang out and get nerdy with us.   photo taken by Anne Celestino   Joining the ACM Listserv  The ACM has a mailing list that is hosted by the University, and it is used to send out important information to and start discussions with ACM members.
