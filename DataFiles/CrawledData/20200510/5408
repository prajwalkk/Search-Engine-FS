When you schedule an appointment with one of our technicians you will receive:   A comprehensive inspection of your child safety seat (forward/rear-facing/boosters) for manufacturers’ product recalls  Education to maintain compliance with Illinois State Law and safety best practices  Hands-on, active participation, installation instruction/demonstration of your safety seat   Please be prepared to contact us when scheduling an appointment well in advance of your safety seat needs, to ensure there are no scheduling conflicts with our technicians.  As well as providing your available dates/times and contact information when scheduling with UIC PD, please relate your child safety seats’ make, model, and serial number, as well as providing your vehicle’s make and model information.  Appointments can take as long as 30 minutes to ensure full safety compliance. It is suggested for you to have your safety seat and vehicle manual during the appointment.  AT THIS TIME THE UIC POLICE DOES NOT OFFER FREE CHILD SAFETY SEATS.  These sessions are open to all people who want to better secure children, not just parents and are provided at NO COST to you.  Help us reduce vehicle-related injuries and contact (312) 99 6-2830 to set up your appointment today.
