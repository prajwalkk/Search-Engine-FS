The Graduate College New Student Orientation  is for any new graduate student, degree-seeking or nondegree, whose program is within the Graduate College .  The session is typically held during the week before Fall Semester begins (towards the middle of August).  New students for Fall register for the orientation through UIC Connect . (Note: Only applicants who have been officially admitted by the Graduate Admissions Office receive access to UIC Connect . Access to UIC Connect is available from the time of official admission through the end of the registration period for the term of admission.)

The Campus-Wide New Teaching Assistant (TA) Orientation is designed for new teaching assistants for Fall Semester. For more information please click on the link in this bullet..  The Office of International Services (OIS) offers a New International Student Orientation that is mandatory for new international (student visa holders) students for Fall and Spring Semesters.  OIS sends information on the orientation directly to the newly admitted international student.  International students with questions should consult the OIS website or contact OIS directly.
