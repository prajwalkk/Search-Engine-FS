opportunity to experience this unique American holiday, OIS hosts its annual
Pumpkin Farm Trip every October. Students in
attendance learn about the American traditions of pumpkin carving and are able
to see midwestern farm animals while experiencing tractor-driven hay rides and
many of the customs associated with Halloween in the U.S.                Pumpkin Farm Trip 2019  Saturday, Oct. 19 9:45 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.     Join OIS on a trip to Siegel's Pumpkin Farm ! Experience typical fall
