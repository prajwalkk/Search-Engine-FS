The residential, healthcare, and research aspects of UIC operations make this a requirement.  In the event of extreme weather conditions, the campus will continue to operate during regularly scheduled hours. Staff are expected to report to their respective offices or workstations. Staff who are not able to commute to campus and who wish to be paid may request that the time missed be charged to vacation time, or make other arrangements. Alternate arrangements are subject to approval by the supervisor and unit head and must meet all University rules and regulations. Policy questions should be directed to Human Resources, Labor and Employee Relations, at (312) 355-3055.  Cancellation of Individual Classes  In individual cases, an instructor may need to cancel a class. Instructors must notify college and departmental offices of such cancellations. All students registered in the class must be informed promptly by e-mail or Blackboard, and the work must be made up later in the semester.  Cancellation of All Scheduled Classes  In accordance with Executive Notice 94-3, all classes will be canceled if, in the judgment of the Chancellor or the Provost, the health and safety of students, faculty, or staff would be seriously jeopardized. In this case, the Vice Chancellors will notify units that report to them. Campus will be notified via Urgent e-mail and sms text messaging to subscribed mobile phones; the UIC.edu website; and the UIC Information Line, (312) 413-9696. Notice will be sent to local radio and television stations for public announcement.  Should you hear on radio or television that the campus is “closed,” know that while classes have been canceled, buildings and offices are open and some special events may take place as scheduled. Faculty and staff with non-instructional responsibilities are not excused when classes are canceled.  UI Hospital Operations During an Emergency  UI Hospital operates continuously regardless of weather. Staff and students assigned to patient care and support functions are expected to report even when classes have been canceled at UIC.  Support and Administrative Functions  Emergency conditions may warrant the suspension of non-essential operations such as university mail delivery or transportation services. The Vice Chancellor for Administrative Services will consult with representatives of campus components likely to be affected by service interruption and notify the other vice chancellors.
