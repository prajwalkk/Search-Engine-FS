How do I enforce Bluestem Authentication for a FormMail form?  How do I run my own Bluestem server?  What do I need to know about web security, restricted access, and Bluestem?  More…            Features   ACCC provides Bluestem protection for websites hosted with webhost.uic.edu and people.uic.edu Web servers for protecting files, PHP programs, and CGI scripts. However, you may have data that requires extra-special protection (e.g. financial or medical), or you may want to run a Web application (e.g. database) or write in a language for which these main servers are not adequate.  In such a case, if you are capable of running your own Web server (i.e. physically secure room, maintain security patches, manage user accounts, run backups, install and troubleshoot software, keep, and inspect logs, or use an ACCC Virtual Machine), you can make your web server into a Bluestem Client or Shibboleth Client application server . This will allow your web scripts to authenticate users, using their normal UIC NetID and password, in a very secure manner.           More Info   Bluestem on people and webhost  Requires the creation of an allowed.NetID file in the directory you want to protect.  Bluestem on a custom server   You must run an SSL-capable web server. Apache and IIS are fine. And, of course, the web server must be configured to run CGI scripts.  You must obtain an SSL certificate .  You must be able to maintain your server, providing all the functions that a good system administrator would provide.
