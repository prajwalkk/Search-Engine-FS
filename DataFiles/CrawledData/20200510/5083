The U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights recently rescinded guidance issued under the Obama Administration and released new, interim guidance around Title IX and sexual misconduct compliance at educational institutions.  We wish to emphasize our promise to continue to provide optimal services, support, resources and guidance and to address sexual misconduct in our community and to those who need assistance.  Regulatory guidance may change but our responsibility to ensure safety to our students, staff and faculty will not.  Our response to sexual misconduct will remain diligent affirming due process, fairness, and dignity.  We will be steadfast in our response and treat all matters with urgency while working towards providing survivors with respect and support with the many available campus resources.  For more information on reporting sexual misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit Report an Incident and Resources .  Sincerely,  Caryn A. Bills Associate Chancellor  Linda Deanna Associate Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Dean of Students  J. Rex Tolliver Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs  For more information, please contact:  oae@uic.edu     Contact   UIC News staff   uicnews-staff@uic.edu     Categories   VC Student Affairs officials                UIC Logo        Today      Contact  Office of Public and Government Affairs 601 S.
