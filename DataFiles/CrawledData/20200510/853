Hear From Our Students        “I loved UIC TIE program! The teachers were great. I did just one medium-intermidiate level session in the Spring, which was enough for me to start taking undergraduate classes at a community college in the Fall of the same year. I learned so much in a very short time. Excellent English program as I am now a nurse and in grad school :). I am very proud to say that I went to one of the best ESL classes in Chicago. I would definitely recommend it”    Jaqueline Silva | Brazil | Nurse          “The best place in Chicago for international students from all around the World to come to learn English. Everyone here is just simply amazing. I love this place.”    Anh Dang | Vietnam                       UIC Logo        The Tutorium         Main Menu    Intensive English    Other Programs    Student Life    About Us    How to Apply      IEP    IEP Courses    IEP Tuition & Fees    IEP Start Dates    Pay Fees    Current Students      More Info    I-20 & Visa    English for International Professionals    Contact Us        Quick Links    Request Information    Apply    Pay Fees         Contact   Tutorium in Intensive English  1333 South Halsted Street, Suite 260 Chicago, Illinois 60607-5019 USA  Phone: +1-312-996-8098  Fax: +1-312-996-4394  tutorium@uic.edu        Social Media Accounts    Facebook    Instagram             UIC.edu links   UIC.edu  Academic Calendar  Athletics  Campus Directory  Disability Resources  Emergency Information  Event Calendar  Job Openings  Library  Maps  UIC Safe Mobile App  UIC Today  UI Health  Veterans Affairs        Powered by Red 2.38.0  © 2020 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois |  Privacy Statement    Campuses   University of Illinois System  Urbana-Champaign  Springfield      Cookie Settings
