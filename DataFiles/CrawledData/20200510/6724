Inspired by President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal and its public work projects as well as by the university’s own mission, the Graduate College has created the Public Service Graduate Internship Award (PSGIA). This summer experience allows UIC graduate students to serve in the interest of the public good while obtaining valuable “hands-on” experience, albeit virtually. For their public service, recipients will receive virtual experience in academic, administrative, and student service units at UIC and a monetary award. ** The deadline has been extended to 5 p.m., May 13th.**  For more information, visit https://go.uic.edu/psgia .
