In the event that allegations of research misconduct are reported, OVCR is responsible for implementing the established procedures for impartial fact finding that leads to the fair adjudication of the allegations.  The procedures, described in the university Policy and Procedures on Integrity in Research and Publication , were established to be in compliance with federal regulations found in the Public Health Service Policies on Research Misconduct (42 CFR Parts 50 and 93).  Research misconduct is defined as fabrication, falsification or plagiarism.  Research misconduct may also include conduct that seriously deviates from accepted ethical guidelines and professional standards in scholarship and research.  Honest error or difference of opinion does not constitute research misconduct.  OVCR fosters Research Integrity campus-wide by contributing to those educational efforts of departments, colleges and schools related to the Responsible Conduct of Research.
