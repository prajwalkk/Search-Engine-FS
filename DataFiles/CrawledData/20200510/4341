Applicants are also encouraged to obtain work experience in the field of veterinary medicine.  In addition to the course work listed above, applicants to the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign must take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). The GRE should be taken after completion of the minimum pre-veterinary medicine course requirements. The minimum science and cumulative GPA for admission to the UIUC College of Veterinary Medicine is 2.75/4.00. The competitive average, however, is considerably above this level at the present time.  Applicants to the UIUC College of Veterinary Medicine must apply through the Veterinary Medical College Application Service (VMCAS) . VMCAS opens in May; the UIUC College of Veterinary Medicine deadline is September 15. Students are advised to declare an educational goal of pre-veterinary medicine upon entering UIC which will alert them to specific workshops and other pertinent information.  The list of courses above includes the recommended courses for application to the UIUC College of Veterinary Medicine. Specific admission requirements of other veterinary medical schools are listed on the VMCAS website. A comprehensive overview of the veterinary admission process is available in the Veterinary Medical School Admission Requirements (VSMSAR) publication. The VMSAR is published by the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges and may be ordered through the Purdue University Press .  Although the minimum requirement for application to the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign through "Plan B" is two years of college credit, few students are admitted at that point. Most students complete at least three years prior to application and earn a bachelor’s degree before matriculating.
