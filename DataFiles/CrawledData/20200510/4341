Must be 200-level or above; may be completed at either a community college or a four-year college or university. Though the requirement may be completed after entry to the program, it is very highly recommended that students complete an upper-division elective with other prerequisite courses prior to enrollment. f Students applying for the RN/BSN Program are requirement to take a total of 4–5 hours of chemistry. This requirement can be fulfilled by taking any of the following UIC courses: CHEM 100 , CHEM 105 , CHEM 122 / CHEM 123 , CHEM 124 / CHEM 125 , CHEM 116 , CHEM 118 , or CHEM 130 , or by completing a 4- to 5-hour chemistry lab course at an accredited community college, college, or university that also satisfies the UIC Analyzing the Natural World lab requirement. These students may need to take additional course(s) approved for General Education to meet the university requirement of 24 hours distributed across the six categories. g Students applying for the RN/BSN Program are not required to take either introductory statistics or organic chemistry. As a result, these students will need to take hours of LAS electives to meet the 57 hours of non-nursing requirements.
