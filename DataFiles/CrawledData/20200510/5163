This webinar will first discuss Down syndrome and the DS behavioral phenotype because it is important to understand Down syndrome when diagnosing DS-ASD. The DS-ASD phenotype will be shared in order to know what autism looks like in individuals with DS. Finally, treatment strategies and resources will be shared.  Learning Objectives:   Participants will understand basic facts about Down syndrome and the DS behavioral phenotype.  Participants will be able to determine what ASD looks like in individuals with Down syndrome.  Participants will identify treatment strategies and resources that are beneficial for individuals with the DS-ASD diagnosis and their families.
