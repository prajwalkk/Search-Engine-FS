Teaching Evidence Based Public Health Nursing     UIC's Library of the Health Sciences at Peoria and College of Nursing at Peoria have a long history of teaching evidence based practice concepts and skills to public health nurses.  Some of the instructional materials included in this guide were developed under previous projects that were funded by the National Library of Medicine (NLM).  These materials have been revised, updated, and incorporated into this single guide to resources and learning.  The NExT project continues to benefit from NLM funding to support some aspects of the project.  The team would like to acknowledge all current and past funding:       This project has been funded in whole or in part with Federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, under Grant Number 1UG4LM012346 with the University of Iowa.
