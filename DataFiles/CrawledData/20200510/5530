The information below provides guidance when online coursework and meetings are scheduled.      Basic Technology Required for Students         Basic Technology Required for Students    Laptop, Chromebook, or desktop computer  Note that Chromebooks are used to perform a variety of browser-based tasks with most data and applications, such as Blackboard Learn, Blackboard Collaborate, Google Docs, and Office 365, residing in the cloud rather than on the machine itself. This can result in somewhat reduced functionality, depending on your needs.  Tablets and phones can work, particularly for joining/participating in online class sessions. Functionality to complete assignments is typically reduced, depending on your needs.  If you do not have reliable access to a computer at home, ACCC may have a laptop to lend to you. Please fill out our request form at accc.uic.edu/forms/laptop-request/  You may need specialized software for some of your courses – if this is the case, please see the Software Resources section just below.    Internet – Many service providers are offering connectivity solutions for students without access to wifi or internet. The Illinois Citizens Utility Board is maintaining a comprehensive list of the available options here: citizensutilityboard.org/blog/2020/03/19/cubs-guide-utility-services-during-the-covid-19-public-health-emergency/ .  The State of Illinois is maintaining a map of publicly available internet hotspots across the state that can be used for academic-related needs. These hotspots are available from within a parked vehicle. The map, and additional information, can be viewed at www.ildceo.net/wifi  Additionally, the ACCC has a very limited supply of cellular hotspots available for those students who are unable to take advantage of the above offers.

Review these tech guides to ensure your computer is ready for online courses.  Have a designated space or area in your home where you will be able to watch courses online with little to no disruptions.  If you’re not confident about your computer skills, meet virtually with a computer savvy friend well before the start of the class to learn some of the shortcuts and strategies for learning and communicating online. Some of your computer habits might not be very efficient, and a quick tutorial with a friend can be invaluable.    Technical Issues   Talk to other students who have taken online courses for tips on how to manage the course.  Watch tutorials for the course so you don’t need to ask the professor unnecessary technical questions.  Back-up your files each time you work online.  Name your files clearly and use folders so you can find documents quickly.  Try to access every part of the course materials. That way you can work out any bugs early on.  Have a back-up plan in case you lose Internet access. Get phone numbers of one or two classmates so you have someone to contact by phone.  Make sure you have a pdf reader.   Be Actively Involved in the Material   If you are reading some of the materials online with the goal of understanding the big picture, read for a while and then stop to write a few notes in your notebook.  For materials that you need to read in more detail, print out the reading and mark it as you would mark a textbook, with notes in the margin and/or selective highlighting.  Don’t hesitate to ask your instructor questions if you don’t understand parts of the material. But do remember that your instructor might not be available to respond to you on the same day or on weekends.   Time Management   The most challenging aspect of online courses is time management. An online course can seem invisible, and it is dangerously easy to forget about the course and fall behind. Also, even when you do make an effort to go online to work on your course, it can be all too tempting to get off track and start accessing Facebook or another site. Use the following strategies to manage your time:  Ask the professor how many hours you should devote to the course per week and do your best to come close to this number.  Treat your computer time for your online course completely differently than you treat personal computer time. In other words, while working on your online class, do not watch TV, talk on the phone, check personal email, surf the Web, or interact with family members .  Schedule specific times for your coursework. Inform people of your schedule and do your very best to stick to it. If someone asks you to do something during your study time, tell the person that you are “in class” at that time.  Print out a course calendar at the beginning of the term with all important due dates clearly noted. Also note times you need to be online for real-time discussions or telecasts. Post this calendar above your computer.   Procrastination  Constantly monitor your progress. If you see that you are falling behind, use some of the strategies below.   Each time you sit down to work on your course, make a list of what you plan to get done and a target time to finish the work . Try hard to meet your target time. You will be forced to avoid your email and other distractions in order to meet your goal.  Monitor each time you give in to a temptation or distraction by writing a tally mark on a piece of paper. Later, count up the number of these marks at the end of a study session. Many students find that a few sessions of this kind of monitoring will dramatically reduce the number of times they get off track.  If you are still having trouble keeping up, partner with one or two fellow students.Decide on a specific time that you will work on class material. Call or email each other at the start of the session and again at the end of the session to check on each other’s progress.

Communication & Netiquette for Online Learning         Communication Guidelines for Online Courses   The quality of your interactions with instructors and classmates have a major impact on your experience as an online student. Keep this “Netiquette” framework and its guidelines in mind as you participate in your online course.  Review and follow your instructor’s communication guidelines.  Your instructor may have communication guidelines that are specific to your online course. Be sure to review your course syllabus and any emails or announcements from your professor to learn about these expectations.  Use a civil tone and non-offensive language.  While you are encouraged to think critically and engage in rigorous debate, please avoid using personal attacks and crude language. This is especially important when discussing topics which may elicit strong personal responses from course participants.  Be cautious when using humor or sarcasm.  With online communication, be more polite than you might be in person. It’s quite easy for misunderstandings to develop online because you aren’t able to use tone of voice or facial expression. If your tone is misunderstood by readers, your words may be taken literally or offensively.  Write clearly and succinctly.  Aim to make your messages easy to read and understand. If you frequently rely on idioms or slang phrases, consider how your messages might be rephrased for clarity.  Attribute any sources you use. Doing so should make your comments more effective while also encouraging a more rigorous and structured debate.  Respect others’ privacy.  Avoid sharing personal information about others without their consent. Conversely, be careful of what you say or write. Remember that anything you write to one person could be easily forwarded to others.
