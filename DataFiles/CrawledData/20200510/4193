Recommended Plan of Study  Physics is a discipline that carefully builds additional knowledge on a foundation of previously learned science and mathematics. To complete the physics curriculum in four years, therefore, requires careful planning, especially because the upper-division courses are offered at most once per year and have prerequisites. A recommended typical course sequence for the BS degree is given below.  Note: Students should consult the General Education section of the catalog for a list of approved courses in each category.

Students who are not prepared to begin MATH 180 in their first semester may need to attend summer school or possibly take more than four years to finish their BS degree.  In addition to the degree programs shown above, there is an Engineering Physics program available through the College of Engineering .
