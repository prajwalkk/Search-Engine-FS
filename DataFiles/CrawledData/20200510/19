Our MS degree booklet provides an introduction to our CS curriculum, students, and alumni.       Options to complete the master's degree     Coursework-only option   In the course option, students complete all the credit hours toward the MS only through coursework.     Project option   The project option allows students to demonstrate their learning in the form of a substantive capstone project. The project work must demonstrate a high level of professional skill, but students do not need to formally present or defend their projects.     Thesis option   The thesis option is designed for graduate students with an interest in computer science research. The thesis option is strongly advised for students who may be interested in pursuing a PhD in the future.
