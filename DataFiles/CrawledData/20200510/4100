We truly value the partnerships we have formed with schools in the Chicagoland area and we are interested in forging more relationships with other local institutions that have similar goals as WIEP. To establish a partnership, we welcome the opportunity to visit your institution for Career Day, College Fairs, or simply conduct a class or presentation about UIC College of Engineering and WIEP opportunities.
