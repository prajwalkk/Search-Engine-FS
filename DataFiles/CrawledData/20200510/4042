The goal of the IBC office is to facilitate the protocol writing/review process for the investigator and to ensure compliance of rDNA and infectious agent research with federal regulations. Protocols are reviewed on a monthly or “as needed” basis with meetings scheduled at least quarterly. The deadline for submissions is the last day of the month for review in the following month. The Office of Research lends administrative assistance to the COM-R IBC.
