Place you’re most likely to be found on campus: In my lab or at Chick-fil-a         Aditi Mallavarapu      PhD in Computer Science | India  Academic focus: Educational data mining, learning sciences, human-computer interface.  What’s the most rewarding part of doing research at UIC? The encouragement and the multi-fold opportunities that open up for me. The exposure to multi-disciplinary research is the key. I can see how my research is making a difference in the world.  What difference do you see yourself making? My current work is with a digital museum, where I am trying to evaluate the learning gains that are achieved by the visitors as they interact with the exhibit. We have been able to design a tool that can give visitors live feedback on how they are performing. The museum-exhibit evaluations have become easier for the staff, and the visitors are more aware of the takeaways from the exhibit.  Find me on: The Magnificent Mile and the Chicago Riverwalk .       Yanzi Jin      PhD in Computer Science | China  Academic focus: Computer vision, specifically the analysis of surveillance videos.  How will your research help the world? Practically, my system will make traffic analysis cheaper and more efficient. More generally, my research addresses the challenges when applying computer vision techniques to real-world problems. Hopefully it will bridge the academic and the practical, and raise awareness for the field.  Why UIC? I knew I would like to work on something that could be applied to real life, and that’s what my advisor, Jakob Eriksson , does.  Home neighborhood in Chicago: Bridgeport       Mohitkumar Paritosh Ghia      MS in Computer Science | India  Academic focus: Artificial intelligence and software development  Why UIC? It was one of the best colleges in terms of research opportunities and course offerings.  Internships: Quality assurance internship at Balyasny Asset Management, summer engineering internship at Midwest Can  Industry person you admire most: Sundar Pichai for his leadership qualities. He also is the backbone of Google in terms of innovation.  How is the MS in Computer Science preparing you for your future goals? First, it is helping me to gather knowledge from various fields in computer science that align with my concentration. Second, it’s giving me an opportunity to grow my overall personality.       Yatri Modi      MS in Computer Science | India  Academic focus: Natural language processing  Why UIC? Some of the best professors are at UIC!  Tell us about one of them: My faculty advisor is Natalie Parde . I was looking to do a thesis in natural language processing; she had just joined UIC and was looking for students to work with. I got in touch with her via email, and after a couple of in-person meetings she agreed to guide me. Possibly one of the most caring, brilliant and kind professors I’ve come across.  Favorite spot on campus: The fourth floor of the library . I get to study peacefully while enjoying the view!       Debojit Kaushik      MS in Computer Science | New Delhi, India  Why UIC? Excellent CS program, and the location of the university. UIC is providing me with the environment and facilities I need to move myself in the direction I want to go in.  Post-graduation goal: Join a product company and also build my own product  Anticipated career: Software product architect  Internship and lab experience: Caterpillar Inc. (software research internship), Innovation Center  Where are you most likely to be found on campus? Daley Library or Student Center East , working collaboratively or meeting friends over coffee and food.       David Randolph   PhD in Computer Science | Joliet, IL  Academic focus: Music informatics, machine learning, educational technology  The UIC advantage: The department advertised a part-time PhD option. It was the only such program I found when I was scouting for somewhere to continue my studies. I was working full-time and needed a place that would be flexible.  Dissertation title: Actionable Computational Models of Piano Fingering  A snapshot of PhD life: I have been lucky enough to collaborate with a number of musicians, engineers, psychologists, and computer scientists, both inside and outside UIC, in a true multi-disciplinary extravaganza. But I think my absolute favorite part was building a Frankenstein digital piano with a micro-controller, foil tape, some mysterious electronic components, and no prior soldering experience.  Research contribution: I like to think that a system that can dispense high-quality fingering advice could someday lead to a tutorial or decision-support system that will help pianists prepare pieces for performance. Better fingering = better music. Also, as injury is a serious issue among pianists, such a system might help pianists to strike a healthier balance between ergonomics and musical expressiveness.       Hamed Rezaei      MS in Computer Science | Iran  Academic focus: Improving congestion-control methods in datacenter networks  What contribution will your research make? Improving user satisfaction.
