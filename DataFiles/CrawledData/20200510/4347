The purpose of the undergraduate guaranteed tuition plan is to provide a high degree of certainty about tuition costs for students and families. The plan applies to all undergraduate students enrolled in a baccalaureate degree program on one of the three campuses of the University of Illinois. The plan treats every student as part of a cohort defined by the date of entry to the university. Each cohort is guaranteed an unchanged tuition schedule for four years. Students extending their graduation beyond four years should be prepared for a tuition increase. Please note that fees are subject to change annually. For more information on guaranteed undergraduate tuition , consult the university-wide student programs website.  Tuition  By registering for classes, students contract to pay tuition and fees unless they officially withdraw by the published refund deadline. Tuition and fees are assessed on registered students and are payable by the due date reflected on the online bill. The amount of tuition and fees varies by the date a student enters the university, changes in student level, changes of program within the university, and the number of semester hours for which the student registers. Subsequent changes in the number of hours carried could result in a change from the amounts originally assessed. Tuition also varies according to the students’ state residence—state of Illinois resident or nonresident. For a description and definition of state resident status, see Regulations Governing the Determination of State Residence Status for Admission and Assessment of Student Tuition later in this section. Tuition and fees are set annually by the University of Illinois Board of Trustees and are subject to change without notice any time prior to the first day of instruction. Consult the Office of the Registrar website for current information on tuition and fees.

Tuition is assessed in accordance with this information. A student who has legitimate cause for change of status may petition for change on a Residency Petition form provided by the Office of Admissions. See Regulations Governing the Determination of State Residence Status for Admission and Assessment of Student Tuition.  Exemptions and Assessments  A student who qualifies under the stated conditions may be exempted from one or more of the following charges. Tuition is waived for:   Holders of tuition-waiver scholarships.  All academic employees, except graduate assistants, of the university on appointment for at least 25 percent of full-time service. Such appointments require service for not less than three-fourths of the term.  Tuition may be waived for the total number of semester hours taken by an academic employee. The total number of semester hours that can be taken by academic employees is determined by the employee’s college.  The staff members must provide service for at least three-quarters of the term in which the course work is taken to maintain the waiver. The term is defined as beginning with the first day of class and extending through final examinations. For staff members who resign their appointments or otherwise become ineligible for a waiver, the waiver is void; the staff member is responsible for payment of the full amount of tuition unless an official withdrawal from the university is initiated immediately.  Enrollment in courses will be in accordance with all university and campus rules and regulations.  The academic/professional employee and his/her head or director will determine the manner in which job responsibilities are to be carried out while the employee is taking course work.    Support staff employees:  Support staff employees of the university in status appointments or in appointments designed to qualify for status in an established class (e.g., trainee, intern) who register in regular university courses not to exceed Range II in a semester if on full-time appointment or Range III if on 50 to 99 percent time appointment. They must also  meet conditions and eligibility for admission as prescribed by the Office of the Registrar;  not be students as defined in Civil Service Rule 7.7c; and  have approval from their employing departments for enrollment and a makeup schedule to cover any time in course attendance during their regular work schedule. The waiver of tuition also applies to any additional hours of registration by employees that keep them within the same fee assessment credit range. Employees whose total registration is in a higher range than that authorized by their tuition waiver pay only the difference between the waiver authorization and the higher range in which their total registration places them.    Support staff employees in a status, learner, trainee, apprentice, or provisional appointment who enroll in regular courses directly related to their university employment are included. The number of credit hours per term may not exceed Range II. Employees must have made application and received prior approval for enrollment as required by procedures issued by the director of support staff personnel and set forth in the publication Policy and Rules Nonacademic .    Holders of graduate tuition-and-fee waivers awarded by the Graduate College.  Holders of outside-sponsored grants or contracts that provide payments to cover the total costs of instruction.  Cooperating teachers and administrators who receive assignment of practice teachers; social agency field instructors who receive assignment of social work students. Such persons who register in university courses are exempted from tuition and the service fee for one semester or summer session for each semester of service rendered. The exemption shall apply to the semester or summer session of registration, as designated by the student, that is concurrent with, or following, the term of service, but must be applied no later than one calendar year from the end of the term of service. Concurrent registration on more than one campus of the university or in university extramural courses constitutes one semester or session of eligibility for exemption.  Persons registered in noncredit seminars only.  University employees registered at the request of their departments in noncredit courses especially established to improve the work of the employee.  University of Illinois retirees.  Illinois residents, age 65 or older, whose annual household income is less than $12,000.  Teacher of the Year.  Fifty percent of tuition is waived for eligible children of eligible University of Illinois employees:  An eligible employee must be a current University of Illinois employee at 50 percent time or more, eligible for employer-provided benefits, and in active status as of the first day of the academic term for which the waiver is being requested (changes in status after the first day will affect only future academic terms). In addition, the employee must have completed at least seven years of eligible employment as of the first day of the academic term, although the seven years do not have to be consecutive.  An eligible child must be under 25 years of age at the beginning of any academic year (defined as the first day of instruction) in which the waiver will be effective; and must be the natural child, adopted child, child of current spouse, or under court-appointed guardianship of the eligible employee. The eligible child must qualify for admission under the same requirements, standards, and policies applicable to general admissions.  The 50 percent tuition waivers under this program apply only to Board of Trustees approved undergraduate tuition rates (not fees). Waivers under this program are applicable at any campus within the University of Illinois system to which the child has been admitted.  Extramural and correspondence courses are not eligible for any waiver under this program.  An eligible child, who remains under the age of 25 at the beginning of any academic year, can expend a total of four years' worth of waivers as long as satisfactory progress toward graduation at the university is maintained. Each year consists of two semesters and one summer session.     The nonresident portion of tuition (if the enrollee is subject to payment of tuition) is waived for:   All staff members (academic, administrative, or permanent support staff) on appointment for at least 25 percent of full time and not less than three-quarters service for the term, or on an appointment for less than 25 percent of full time with the university. The faculties of state-supported institutions of higher education in Illinois holding appointments of at least one-quarter time.  The professional staff in private and public elementary and secondary schools in Illinois.  The spouses and dependent children of those listed in items 1 and 2. (Dependent children are those who qualify as dependents for federal income tax purposes.)  Persons actively serving in one of the armed forces of the United States who are stationed and present in Illinois in connection with that service.  The spouses and dependent children of those listed in item 5, as long as they remain stationed, present, and living in Illinois.  Military veterans (specific requirements to be announced).   For assessment purposes, a staff appointment must require service for not less than three-fourths of the academic term. Specific dates marking completion of service for three-fourths of the term shall be established by the chancellor or his designee on each campus. Staff tuition-and-fee privileges do not apply to students employed on an hourly basis in either an academic or support staff capacity or to persons on leave without pay.  For assessment purposes, a permanent support staff employee is defined as a person who has been assigned to an established, permanent, and continuous support staff position and who is employed for at least 25 percent of full time. University employees appointed to established, civil service positions whose rate of pay is determined by negotiation, prevailing rates, or union affiliation are entitled to the same tuition-and-fee privileges accorded other staff members under the regulation.  For assessment purposes, an academic/professional employee is defined as an employee whose appointment is not prescribed by Article X, Section 1, of the University Statutes , or for whom the rules of the University Civil Service System are not applicable. Therefore, academic/professionals are those staff members who are not   in the professorial ranks,  instructors or lecturers,  research or teaching associates,  research or teaching assistants (graduate or undergraduate), or  support staff (University Civil Service) employees.   Staff members who have “visiting” or “adjunct” prefixes to the above ranks in their titles are also excluded from the academic/professional category.  Excluded are all academic/professional appointees on leaves of absence without pay.  A student who resigns a support staff or academic appointment, or whose appointment is cancelled before service has been rendered for at least three-fourths of the term, becomes subject to the full amount of the appropriate tuition and fees for that term, unless withdrawal from the university classes is effective at the same time the appointment becomes void or unless clearance for graduation is filed within one week after the appointment becomes void.  Fees  All fees are subject to change without notice.  Application Fee  All applicants for admission pay a nonrefundable application fee of $50 for domestic and international students. Undergraduates applying for readmission are not required to pay another application fee.  The application fee may be waived for:   Members of the university faculty and staff.  Extramural nondegree applicants.  Applicants who, because of extreme financial hardship, cannot meet the cost of the fee. (Subject to the approval of the Managing Director of Admissions.)  Applicants under approved international exchange programs in which the university participates and international students participating in approved exchange programs where the waiver of fees is reciprocal.  University of Illinois intercampus transfers at the same level: undergraduate to undergraduate, graduate to graduate, or professional to professional.  Applicants denied admission to one campus who wish to apply for admission on the same level at another campus for the same term.  Graduate and professional applicants whose entry is advanced or delayed by action of their major departments.  UIC students applying for work on a second campus as concurrent registrants.  Cooperating teachers and administrators who receive assignment of student teachers; social agency field instructors who receive assignment of social work students.

The transcript request fee is assessed for each transcript request.  The first four requests for verification of enrollment or graduation verification per semester are free. Each thereafter incurs a certification fee of $5 for each verification of enrollment or graduation verification. Exact change, check, or money order required.   CampusCare Student Health Benefit Program  The university requires all students to have healthcare coverage. All registered students, charged with tuition and fees, are automatically enrolled in CampusCare and assessed the CampusCare fee as part of their tuition. CampusCare is the University-Based Health Benefits program designed to provide protection against unexpected accidents and illnesses. The program covers services such as physician office visits at the Family Medicine Center, inpatient and outpatient hospital services, prescription drugs, physical therapy, emergency services, home health care, mental health, substance abuse, and vision and dental services.  During the open enrollment period at the beginning of each term, new and continuing students have an opportunity to make choices concerning their healthcare coverage. Students enrolled in CampusCare may also enroll qualified dependents such as a spouse or children before the published deadline date.  Coverage is based on a semester basis with no lapse in coverage between semesters for registered students. CampusCare members who are eligible during the spring term are able to enroll for summer coverage, without being registered for the summer term, by filling out a Summer Continuation Form online prior to the deadline. All coverage dates and fees can be found online. The CampusCare Fee is billed with tuition and other mandatory fees, unless a CampusCare waiver is approved. Students who withdraw from the university and are not reimbursed 100% of their tuition and fees do not receive a refund of the CampusCare Fee and are covered for the balance of the semester from which they withdrew. CampusCare does not prorate the benefit premium.  Students who show proof of active Affordable Care Act-qualified health insurance coverage prior to the enrollment period deadline date may waive out of the program by logging onto the CampusCare website and submitting an online waiver form. Once approved, a waiver will remain in effect for a period of one academic year. Beginning Fall Semester 2014, all students applying and approved for a CampusCare waiver for the first time will now have to reapply for the waiver at the beginning of each academic year.  Students may reinstate into CampusCare upon completion of an online reinstatement form found on the CampusCare website . All forms to waive out, reinstate coverage, or to add/delete dependents must be submitted online only before the enrollment period deadline date.  Detailed information about covered benefits, premium rates, dependent coverage, summer coverage, how to access care, print ID cards, deadline dates, and all online forms are available to students on the CampusCare website . Information is also available in the online Schedule of Classes and the UIC home page by typing CampusCare in the search function.  Payment of Tuition and Fees  University Student Financial Services and Cashier Operations 1900 Student Services Building (SSB) (312) 996-8574  usfscohelp@uillinois.edu  http://paymybill.uillinois.edu  University Student Financial Services and Cashier Operations (USFSCO) is the central billing unit of the University of Illinois. The office is responsible for billing student account transactions including tuition and fees and collecting payment for the university. The office is different from the Office of Student Financial Aid in that it is not involved with awarding and processing student financial aid like loans and grants. USFSCO is the office students contact if they have questions about charges or credits on their student account or need information about making payments to the university for their student account balance. USFSCO also handles inquiries regarding refunds for student account overpayments. Students are encouraged to review the USFSCO website to become familiar with services and policies.

Subscribe to UIC's Student Money Management Center's monthly e-newsletter .   Viewing the Student Account  At the beginning of each month, students with new account activity will receive an email to their university email address reminding them to view their Student Account. It is the student’s responsibility to monitor their official university email account on a regular basis. Authorized Payers will also receive an email notification to check their student's Student Account when there is new activity.  Payment Methods  The university accepts both e-checks and credit card payments online through UI-Pay. An e-check is an electronic withdrawal from a checking or savings account at a domestic (U.S.) bank account. Credit cards accepted for payment are Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. All credit card transactions will be assessed a 2.4% service fee. Please visit the USFSCO website for additional detail on payment methods.  Mailed payments should be sent at least five business days prior to the due date. The student name and University ID Number (UIN) must be written on the check. A printed copy of the payment stub must be included to ensure proper credit.

Refund on Withdrawal from a Course  If a drop from a course is completed by the second Friday of instruction of the fall or spring semester (the first Wednesday of instruction of Summer Session 1 or first Friday of Summer Session 2) and results in a reduction in the student’s total hours to a lower tuition-and-fee range, the full difference is refunded and no W is recorded.  Refund on Withdrawal to Enter U.S. Military Service  A student who withdraws from the university to enter military service must meet certain requirements in order to be eligible to receive a refund of tuition and fees or receive academic credit.

Cancellation of Enrollment  Students who wish to cancel their registration and receive a complete refund of tuition and fees must do so by the end of the online add/drop period. They may do this online or in person at the Office of the Registrar.  Important Note: If a student receives federally funded financial aid, the refund may be adjusted in accordance with federal regulations. If a student owes money to the university, the refund will be reduced by the amount owed.  Regulations Governing the Determination of State Residence Status for Admission and Assessment of Student Tuition  The University of Illinois is a land-grant institution assisted by funding from state of Illinois tax revenue. As a state, tax-assisted institution, the university (with some exceptions) extends preference in admission and tuition to residents of the state of Illinois—that is, to students whose circumstances conform to the university’s definition of state resident status stated below.  The University of Illinois’ definition of the term “resident” may be different from the definitions developed by other, non-university agencies. Thus, a person who is an Illinois resident for tax or voting purposes, for example, is not necessarily a state resident for University of Illinois tuition and admission purposes. The university’s definition of state resident status applies both to payment of tuition and admission to the University of Illinois.  Principal elements determining state residency are domicile in Illinois and actions that evidence the intent to make Illinois the person’s permanent residence. A person has but one domicile at any time. Mere physical presence in Illinois, regardless of how prolonged, is insufficient to establish state residency without existence of action and intention to make the place a permanent residence and principal home. In order to establish bona fide residence in Illinois under this policy, a person must demonstrate presence and intent to reside permanently in Illinois for reasons other than educational objectives.  The burden of establishing that a student is domiciled in Illinois for other than educational purposes is upon the person. The regulations, factors, and procedures enumerated in this policy will be considered by the university in determining state residence status.  State residence status regulations are subject to change from time to time at the discretion of the Board of Trustees. A person holding nonresident status is subject to rules in effect when the petition seeking Illinois residency is filed. Nothing in these rules shall be applied retroactively to reverse in-state residence status previously granted under former regulations.  Regulations  The following regulations are used to determine the state resident classification of a person for admission and tuition assessment.  A. A person’s domicile is presumed to be that of his/her parent(s) or legal guardian unless the student is independent and establishes a separate domicile. A person who is dependent upon his/her parent(s) or other person in authority, other than spouse, for financial support shall not be considered independent for the purpose of these regulations. A person claiming independence may be requested to present satisfactory evidence that his/her parent(s) or legal guardian have not contributed significantly to his/her support nor claimed him/her as a dependent for federal or state income tax purposes during the period in which the person attempts to establish and/or maintain residency. Filing and payment of Illinois income tax is necessary to establish residency.  B. In order to be classified as a resident for purposes of admission, an independent person shall be domiciled in Illinois and a bona fide resident of the state for at least one calendar year immediately preceding the date of receipt of the application for admission. To be considered a resident for purposes of assessment of tuition, an independent person must be a bona fide resident of the state for at east one calendar year immediately preceding the first scheduled day of classes for the term for which residency is sought.  C. During the one-year period in which a person attempts to establish residency, a person must be financially independent. He/she must rely upon gainful employment in Illinois or prove reliance upon resources in Illinois for more than fifty percent of the income sufficient to provide for tuition, fees, and normal living expenses, e.g., food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Income earned as a result of university enrollment, such as educational loans, graduate assistantships, or student employment, is not considered as evidence of intent to establish residency. During the one-year period in which a person attempts to establish Illinois residency, a person must reside in the state primarily for other than educational purposes.  D. A person who is not a citizen of the United States of America may establish resident status unless the person holds a visa, which precludes an intent to permanently reside in the United States. A list of the visa classifications may be obtained from the Office of Admissions.  E. Noncitizens may commence establishment of state residence with notification of permanent residency status by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services provided the person meets and complies with all the applicable requirements of these Regulations.  F. The minor children of persons who, having resided in this state for at least 12 months immediately prior to such a transfer, are transferred by their employers to some location outside the United States shall be considered as Illinois residents for purposes of the computation and payment of tuition. However, this Section shall apply only when the minor children of such parents enroll in a state-supported college or university within five years from the time their parents are transferred to some location outside the United States. If the parent(s) or legal guardian of a resident person establishes a domicile outside the state of Illinois after the person has been admitted, the person shall continue to be classified as a resident student until degree completion, assuming timely matriculation and providing the person maintains continuous enrollment and maintains a separate residence within the state of Illinois.  G. It is required that a person who claims Illinois domicile while living in another state or country will provide proof of the continued Illinois domicile. Proof may include, but is not limited to, evidence that the person (or parent or legal guardian as applicable) has not acquired a domicile in another state, has maintained a continuous voting record in Illinois, and has filed regular Illinois resident state income tax returns during absence from the state.  H. A person whose parents move to Illinois may become a resident at the beginning of the next term following the move.  An independent person whose parent or parents have established and are maintaining a bona fide residence in Illinois will be regarded as a resident if the independent person lives in Illinois.  Even though a divorced or separated parent who is not a resident of Illinois provides significant financial support, a person shall be classified as a resident as long as the other parent resides permanently in Illinois.  I. A nonresident shall be classified as a resident if his/her spouse is a resident of Illinois and meets the applicable requirements of these regulations. A noncitizen may establish residency through his/her resident spouse, provided the noncitizen complies with Section D of these regulations.  J. A person who is actively serving in the armed forces of the United States and who is stationed and/or present in the state in connection with that service, may be eligible for a waiver of the nonresident portion of tuition in accordance with Board policy as long as the person remains stationed and/or present in Illinois. The waiver is extended to the person’s spouse and dependent children when they also live in the state. A resident of Illinois, and the spouse and dependent children, who is stationed outside of Illinois in active service in the armed forces of the United States and who has maintained residency under Section G shall be classified as a resident.  K. Staff members of the university and of allied agencies, and faculties of state-assisted institutions of higher education in Illinois, holding an appointment of at least one-quarter time, and their spouses and dependent children, shall be treated as residents.  The term “staff member” as used in these regulations shall mean a person appointed to a faculty, academic professional, or permanent civil service position for a specific amount of time at a salary or wage commensurate with the percentage of time required. The appointment shall require service for not less than three-fourths of the term. For purposes of residency, the term “staff member” shall not apply to persons employed on an hourly basis in an academic capacity, nor to persons on leave without pay.  L. Nonresident teachers in the private and public elementary and secondary schools in Illinois holding an appointment of at least one-quarter time shall, if required to pay tuition, be assessed at the resident rate. This privilege also extends to the summer session immediately following the term of the appointment.  Any nonresident teacher who qualifies for resident tuition as described above shall become subject to nonresident tuition for the entire term if the school appointment is vacated prior to completion of three-fourths of the term in question. Resignation or cancellation of the appointment prior to the close of the spring term also cancels the eligibility for the resident tuition privilege in the following summer term.  Factors in Determining State Residency  Bona fide residency must be maintained in the state of Illinois for at least one calendar year immediately preceding the date of receipt of the application for admission; or for tuition purposes, one calendar year immediately preceding the first scheduled day of classes for the term for which resident classification is sought. The following circumstances, although not necessarily conclusive, have probative value in support of a claim for state resident classification.   Continuous physical presence—defined as no more than a three-week absence from the state of Illinois—for at least one calendar year as described above.  Domicile in Illinois of parent(s) or guardian legally responsible for the student. Domicile in Illinois of spouse.  Voting or registration for voting in Illinois.  Illinois driver’s license or identification card and automobile registration.  Financial independence and payment and filing of Illinois income/property taxes and/or ownership of property in Illinois during the tax year or partial tax year immediately preceding the term for which the person is requesting resident classification. Just the filing of an Illinois state income tax form, or filing a form without substantial Illinois income earned, will not be judged as a significant criterion for reclassification.  One calendar year of gainful employment in Illinois or proven reliance upon resources in Illinois for more than fifty percent of the income sufficient to provide for tuition, fees, and normal living expenses, e.g., food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Reliance upon income earned from loans is not viewed as evidence of intent to establish residency. Employment in Illinois must be in other than graduate assistantships or student employment.  The lease of living quarters and payment of utility bills in Illinois.  Former domicile in the state and maintenance of significant connections therein while absent.  Admission to a licensed practicing profession in Illinois.  Long-term military commitments in Illinois and/or proof that Illinois is the home of record.  A one calendar year period of presence in the state for other than educational purposes.  Establishment of financial accounts at Illinois institutions.  Public records, for example, birth and marriage records.  Other official documents verifying legal, official connection with Illinois or with organizations or institutions within the state of Illinois.  Exclusive use of the Illinois address when home or mailing address is requested.   The university may request documentation of the evidence. Missing evidence, the lack of evidence, or inconsistent evidence may be used to refute the claim of state residency.  Procedures  The Registrar, or a designee, shall determine the initial state residence classification of each person at the time the person enters or re-enters the university.  A person who is not satisfied with the determination of his/her state residence classification may request that the responsible official reconsider it. For the purposes of admission, the written request must be received by the Office of Admissions within 20 calendar days from the date of notification of state residency status. For the purposes of assessment of tuition, the written request must be received by the Office of Admissions by September 30 for the fall semester, February 15 for the spring semester, June 20 for the summer term, or some other date as set by the Office of Admissions.  The request should include the Petition for Determination of Residency Status (available online and from the Office of Admissions) and all other materials that are applicable to the claim. The request and accompanying documentation will not be returned, and the person is advised to maintain a copy for his/her record.  If the person is still not satisfied with the determination after it has been reconsidered, the person may appeal the decision to the director, Office of University-Wide Student Programs. The appeal shall be in writing and shall include reasons for the appeal. The appeal must be received by the executive director of admissions within 20 calendar days of the notice of the ruling. The appeal will then be referred to the Office of University-Wide Student Programs. A person who fails to file such an appeal within 20 calendar days of the notice of the ruling waives all claims to reconsideration for that academic session. Filing deadlines cannot be extended or waived, and late applications and appeals will not be reviewed. The decision of the Office of University-Wide Student Programs shall be final in all cases.  A person may be reclassified at any time by the university upon the basis of additional or changed information. If the person is classified in error as a state resident, nonresident tuition shall be assessed in the next term; if the person is classified in error as a nonresident, state resident tuition shall be assessed in the term in which the classification occurs, provided the person has filed a written request for a review in accordance with these regulations.  A person who fails to notify the university of a change of facts or provides false information that might affect classification or reclassification from state resident to nonresident status and/or who provides false information or conceals information for the purpose of achieving resident status may be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, as well as other penalties which may be prescribed by law.
