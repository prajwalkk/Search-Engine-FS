Noche de Ciencias is a national event that occurs to increase interest and promote science, technology, engineering, and math. In Chicago, the event included hands-on activities that showed students in 6th through 12th grades the creativity of engineering while supplying them with information on STEM education and careers.  “Our mission is to support our members to successfully achieve in their careers and empower our community to strive for similar success. Noche de Ciencias is an opportunity for SHPE to inspire families to get involved in STEM and help to answer important questions about college,” said Daisy Cueto, a student in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, in a statement. “It is crucial that we advocate to our community because we do not always receive the same opportunities or information. As students who are fortunate to be studying STEM in a university, we are determined to mentor and inspire younger students.”      Modified on August 13, 2019                  UIC Logo         College of  Engineering            Contact   College of Engineering  851 S.
