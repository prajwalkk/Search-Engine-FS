INDIGO collects, disseminates, and provides persistent and reliable access to the research and scholarship of faculty, staff, and students at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Faculty, staff, and graduate students can deposit their research and scholarship - unpublished and, in many cases, published - directly into INDIGO.

The University Library supports publishing and scholarly communication through this repository and through our journal publishing platform Journals@UIC . These are part of the library's efforts to support eScholarship@UIC .
