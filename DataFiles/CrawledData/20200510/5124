The topic of disability is limited in many areas of study, but understanding and awareness is critical as we all experience disability. It’s important to appreciate the cultural context, complex history, and sociopolitical environment that impact the lives of people with disabilities and their position in the world.  Our program is home to faculty, researchers and students with backgrounds in health, education, assistive technology, social sciences and humanities. We offer a unique opportunity to study the full complexity of disability with an interdisciplinary exploration including healthcare, culture, politics, economics, history, legislation, education and social attitudes.
