Students will receive email instructions to login to www.my.uic.edu . From there, students can click on the "Student" tab and then click on the portlet for "Electronic Financial Aid Notification" and select an appropriate aid year.  SFAS begins awarding aid to incoming students by February. Continuing students are awarded in June. Students should accept financial aid notifications online as soon as possible so the SFAS can finalize packaging for the upcoming year.  Important: Initial financial aid notifications are based upon full-time enrollment for the fall and spring terms. When reviewing a financial aid notification online, report any changes in enrollment so adjustments may be made. If adjustments are not made in advance, awards will be corrected based upon actual enrollment after the add/drop period each semester. Students who do not enroll full-time will be billed after the add/drop period for any refund/financial aid overpayment if they do not report the changes.  Financial Aid Notification Adjustments  Financial aid awards can be increased, decreased, or canceled at any time due to outside financial resources (tuition waivers and scholarships), pending required documentation, corrections to FAFSAs, or enrollment adjustments. If aid is adjusted, students will receive an email notification of a revised electronic financial aid notification.
