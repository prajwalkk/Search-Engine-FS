Who we are and what we do?           Who We Are             What We Do          The LCLC is named in memory of Sandi Port Errant.         Sandi Port Errant celebrated many friendships throughout her 55 years of life, always lending a helping hand to individuals and organizations in need of support, ideas or friendly advice. It is fitting that this center for language and culture, which brings students and faculty of all backgrounds together, memorializes Sandi.  Made possible through a generous gift from her father, Sidney L. Port, a graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign and founder of Lawson Products, Inc., the center will enhance the UIC student experience. May it serve as a lasting testament to the extraordinary impact Sandi had on the lives of so many people.
