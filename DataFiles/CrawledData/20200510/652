For Questions or assistance, you can submit a ticket to Ask a Librarian or call the Daley Circulation unit at (312) 996-2724.   Fines Policy  Borrowers are responsible for library materials until they are checked in at an appropriate location.  The library is not responsible for notifying borrowers that materials are overdue. Reminders and overdue notices are mailed as a courtesy. Failure to receive reminders or overdue notices does not excuse borrowers from the responsibility of returning or renewing items on time to avoid penalties.  Users are responsible for paying all outstanding fines and other fees. Faculty and staff are not assessed fines, but will be billed for damaged or lost items.  The UIC Daley Library does not charge overdue fines for most circulating items. There are exceptions:   Recalled items, Course Reserve materials, and media accrue a daily fine of $5 per day up to $20.  Core Course Textbooks accrue an hourly fine of $1 per hour up to $20.  Other items, including Interlibrary Loan items from other institutions, will incur daily or hourly fines based on the policies of the lending library.   Overdue fines apply at all times, including holidays, vacations and intersession. All overdue items that exceed their fine limit or have not been returned after 39 days are billed to the user account as “Lost”.  Lost Materials  UIC materials that are not returned or renewed within 39 days after their due date are automatically marked with a “Lost” status and billed to the user. The following fees are charged for each item that is “Lost”:   $125 minimum replacement fee for most collections, which may be increased at the discretion of the Library if the item’s value exceeds $125.  $25 non-refundable processing fee.   For items returned within 1 year after being marked “Lost”, the replacement fee will be waived, but any overdue fines or processing fees incurred will remain. After 1 year, users must discuss their balance with Library.  Damaged Items  The charge for damaged items will be determined by the Library depending on an assessment of the severity of the damage, up to the full replacement fee of $125.  Damaged items may be replaced by borrowers in lieu of paying the replacement costs.  Charges for damaged Interlibrary Loan or I-Share items from other institutions are determined by the lending library.  Replacement Materials  The Daley Library will accept a replacement copy of a lost or damaged UIC item in lieu of the lost item replacement fee  Replacement copies must match the lost item based on title, edition, and ISBN or ISSN number, and must be new or used in very good or better condition (clean, unmarked, untorn, with an intact spine and binding).  Former library copies cannot be accepted.  Interlibrary Loan or I-Share items may be eligible for replacement. Contact the lending library for details.  All replacement copies should be brought to a Daley Library Circulation supervisor in-person. If an item must be mailed, it must include your name and contact information, as well as a note that identifies the item as a replacement, so we can process the book correctly and credit your account.  The Library reserves the right to determine whether a replacement copy is acceptable.  Paying Fees  Payments are not accepted at the Library. Charges can be paid through the Office of Business and Financial Services .  Refunds  Refunds are given for paid replacement charges only for UIC library materials returned in good condition within 1 year from the original due date.  If you find and return an item within 1 year of paying for its replacement, contact Circulation to request a refund of the lost item replacement fee.  Account Suspension & Academic Blocks  An outstanding balance will result in the temporary suspension of borrowing and renewing privileges and an academic block at the University Registrar. Outstanding overdue materials borrowed through ILL and I-Share can also result in an academic block.  This block will prevent future enrollment/registration and access to other University services (including transcript requests and the receipt of graduation diplomas) until charges are resolved.  Academic blocks are removed within 5 to 10 business days after library charges are resolved.  Appealing Fines, Claiming Items Returned, & Reporting Loss or Damage  Please submit a ticket to UIC Ask a Librarian to appeal any fines you feel were assessed in error, to claim that you’ve already returned or never borrowed an item checked out to your account, or to report a lost or damaged item.  You can also call the Circulation unit at (312) 996-2724.  Library staff will review your appeal or claim and grant or deny it based on the circumstances, including your overall library record. Items claimed returned will be searched for by library staff twice over a 3-week period; if not found, library staff will declare the item “Lost” and the item will be billed.      How Do I...?
