CampusCare only covers health services provided in the United States. In addition to the required international health insurance coverage, students studying abroad must have domestic coverage in order to waive out of CampusCare . CampusCare coverage can be continued during semesters abroad to provide domestic health coverage in the event it is needed.  Students participating in a recognized Study Abroad Program who have not previously waived CampusCare coverage will be automatically enrolled (along with any enrolled dependents) in CampusCare for their term abroad and assessed the Student Health Insurance Fee.  Students who do not wish to have concurrent domestic health benefits coverage under CampusCare during their term abroad must submit a Waiver Form before the Enrollment Period Deadline Date .  Students who previously waived out of CampusCare but wish to have concurrent domestic coverage under CampusCare during their term abroad should submit a Reinstatement Form before the Enrollment Period Deadline Date . Students may also enroll eligible dependents by submitting the Dependent Enrollment Form before the Enrollment Period Deadline Date .       © Copyright 2014-2020 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois     Footer Navigation                    Vice Provost for Global Engagement  Office of External Scholarships  Office of Financial Aid  University Registrar  Centers for Diversity  Disability Resources  Privacy Policy  Contact Us     Translate »  Cookie Settings
