These workshops will address the search process, issues of implicit bias and stereotypes, as well as other issues that can affect the fairness of a search. They will be presented through a partnership among the Office for Access and Equity, the Office of Diversity and the Office Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs.  They will be offered twice monthly on the east and west sides of campus.  Searches will not be allowed to go forward unless all of the members of the committee have participated in a training workshop by the time the Meets Minimum Qualifications list is submitted to the Office for Access and Equity. It is strongly recommended that heads and chairs whose departments are undertaking searches also do the training.  This training aligns with UIC’s strategic priority that states: “We will intensify our efforts to retain and recruit top-tier faculty members committed to the mission of our University. We will continue to nurture an open and friendly environment that celebrates diversity and promotes excellence.”  After participating in the workshop, one may serve on search committees for three years without retaking the training. Anyone who registered and participated in a workshop after February 1, 2017, has satisfied this requirement. Please find the latest list of attendees here . This list is updated within 48 hours of each training session.
