The Civil Engineering Professional Advisory Council (CEPAC) joined donors, students, and faculty for the annual Scholarship Reception and Awards Dinner at UIC.  Through the generosity of donors and partners, CME awarded 64 scholarships to students. The support helps UIC in its mission to continue to provide access to excellence and success for our students. Board members, many of whom are UIC alumnus, added personal stories to the ceremony as they detailed the scholarship requirements and the interests and accomplishments of the donors.  During the event, students received a certificate, and, in many cases, they were able to meet the donor of their scholarship or a corporate representative as they networked during dinner and after the scholarships were awarded.
