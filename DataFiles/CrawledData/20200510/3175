OIS Services Moving All Online Effective March 17  In response to federal and state government recommendations regarding
size limits for group gatherings, the Office of International Services
will move all services online, effective immediately. Our office in SSB
will be closed to foot traffic until further notice.  OIS Advisors remain available during regular business hours, 8:30
a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. You can call (312) 996-3121 or
email ( ois@uic.edu )
to schedule a phone or video conferencing appointment. We will announce
registration information for online versions of our OPT workshops, tax
workshop and more very soon.  All immigration documents issued by OIS will continue to be
processed, however, documents will be distributed by mail rather than
collected in-person. This includes initial and continuing student
I-20s/DS-2019s, J-1 scholar DS-2019s, and employment based petitions
such as H-1B, O-1, PR, etc. Travel signature requests will be completed
by reprinting, signing and mailing a new document rather than submitting
an existing document for signature. OIS Advisors will provide details
on how to obtain your document when processing your request.  As international educators we believe in the value of face-to-face
interactions in creating understanding, especially in challenging times.
The decision to close our doors to foot traffic was not taken lightly
but it is in the best interest of safety for all. We remain committed to
serving the UIC international community and are working to make sure
your access to advising, document issuance, benefit applications and
other resources is as uninterrupted as possible. Please call (312)
996-3121 or email ( ois@uic.edu ) with any questions or concerns and continue to utilize today.uic.edu/coronavirus as your most up-to-date and complete source of news, policy and
resources regarding the University’s response to coronavirus/COVID-19.           xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
