As such, all on-site and set appointments will be suspended until the end of the semester, if not longer.  Please know that all financial aid counseling and scholarship staff are working remotely to support all student needs. The best manner to reach scholarship staff during this time is via email to scholarshiphelp@uic.edu .  We appreciate all of your patience during this extraordinary time, and intend to provide continued support to all of our students while maintaining continuity in all financial aid and scholarship processes.      The Office of Scholarships assists current UIC undergraduate and professional school students in searching and applying for campus scholarship and external opportunities. We do not award scholarships, and our services are available to current UIC undergraduates and professional students only.  We help students present themselves clearly and effectively for awards that best suit their needs. Our office can offer guidance on communication about academic achievement, co-curricular involvement, life experiences and financial need. Students are welcome at any point in their degree program, and are encouraged to plan ahead to prepare the strongest possible scholarship applications.  UIC undergraduate and professional school students interested in applying for nationally and internationally competitive scholarships, fellowships and external scholarship awards are encouraged to visit the Office of External Fellowships website.  UIC graduate students are encouraged to contact the Fellowships and Financial Aid Coordinator at the Graduate College.
