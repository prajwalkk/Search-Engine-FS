Students can apply for housing as soon as they are accepted to UIC! There is not a deadline for applications, however, we encourage students to apply by April 1 if they have a specific building and/or room request or a roommate request.    Learn more reasons to live on campus today!         Apply Now!       Continue Your Application       Process   Room Assignment Process   Assignments are made in a rolling fashion based on the date we receive the application fee. Building and room preferences are subject to availability, based on your Campus Housing application date.  Contracts for housing assignments will begin to be sent out at the end of May for Fall contracts and beginning of January for Spring semester. Once your contract has been issued, you will go online to e-sign your contract and pay your $100 (refundable) security deposit.  Contracts are continually sent out on a rolling basis after the initial contracts are sent.  Receipt of application by the Campus Housing Office (or the date of a student’s admission to UIC, whichever is later) determines priority date for assignments.   You can change your preferences at any time until you receive your contract.  Visit MyContract to make changes to your application.
