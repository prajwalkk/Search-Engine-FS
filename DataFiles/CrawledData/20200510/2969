Decisions about licensure are a joint effort of a candidate’s program, CTE, and the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE). The program coordinator and faculty have the main responsibility for ensuring that candidates are prepared to become licensed teachers and are, thus, entitled to apply for licensure. Program coordinators approve qualifications before the CTE evaluation process begins. The CTE’s licensure officer entitles an individual to apply for a license at the state level. The CTE checks that candidates have met state requirements, such as passing the required state-level tests and completing the course, assessment, and grade requirements stipulated by the program as addressing state objectives. ISBE makes the final decision about whether or not a candidate receives licensure based upon the information it receives from the institution and a candidate’s application.  The CTE serves programs in the College of Education, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the College of Nursing, and the Jane Addams College of Social Work.  Admission to Candidacy  To be eligible for candidacy, candidates must meet the following criteria:   Completed specific course work per program requirements; earned a minimum cumulative undergraduate GPA as specified by the program, including transfer credits; and completed professional education requirements.  Completed the minimum number of clock hours of fieldwork specified by the program and as part of the professional education course work.  Passed the Illinois Test of Academic Proficiency (TAP). a A minimum ACT Plus Writing composite score of 22 or higher and a Writing Score of 6 or higher or a SAT composite score of 1110 or higher (critical reading and mathematics) and a writing score of 26 or higher may be substituted in place of the TAP. b Scores from the TAP or ACT & SAT (in lieu of TAP) are valid indefinitely.  Completed all other requirements as specified by the program.   Admission to Student Teaching  To be eligible for student teaching, candidates must meet the following criteria:   Completed specific course work; earned a minimum cumulative GPA as specified by the program in all course work, including transfer credits; completed professional education requirements with a minimum as specified by the program; and completed course work in their teaching field with a GPA as specified by their program.

Entitlement to Illinois State Licensure  To become licensed, candidates must have done the following:   Met all requirements for graduation in their home college.  Completed all early field experiences.  Passed all assessments including all licensure exams and the Illinois content area test.  Successfully completed student teaching.  Completed the Teacher Safety Education Module.  Completed and filed a licensure application and any related endorsement requests with the Council on Teacher Education.  Passed the edTPA.

The TAP or a substitute test must be passed prior to applying for candidacy. The Illinois content area test must be passed before the candidate is allowed to student teach. Lastly, a teaching license is not issued until a student passes the final performance assessment, the edTPA.  ISBE occasionally changes the requirements for licensure.
