UIC's Equity and Inclusion in Engineering Program has played a key role in providing academic and professional development services to students for more than 30 years. We serve more than 300 students across all backgrounds, but a central part of our mission is to support underrepresented Black, Latino, and Native American students in their pursuit of engineering and computer science degrees.       testimonial 1             “There is a strong sense of community [in this program]. You end up forming your own little family at school that you can always go to for help. I am still in contact with peers who already graduated, and I know that’s a network I will always rely on.”        Ana Escoto-Cardenas, BS ’16 | Current master's student in industrial engineering                       Get to know us!
