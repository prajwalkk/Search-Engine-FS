Lockdown         Lockdown    ­Close and lock the door behind you, if possible. If the door is unable to be locked, barricade the doorway with heavy, solid objects (e.g., desks, tables, cabinets).  ­Place yourself and others in the room behind a solid object away from the interior door. Keep others calm and quiet.  Close any blinds facing the interior space and turn off lights and computer monitors.  ­Place mobile phones on silent, but monitor them for UIC ALERT Emergency Noti­fication System (ENS) updates.  ­If safe to do so, call the UIC Police Department to provide certain pertinent information (i.e., your building address).  ­Should a fire alarm go off in your building while the incident is in progress and the “all clear” has NOT been given, DO NOT EVACUATE a secure space unless you observe evidence of ­fire or smoke.  ­ DO NOT attempt to negotiate with the active threat/shooter.  ­DO NOT open the door until a KNOWN law enforcement officer advises it is safe to do so, or other credible information is received advising the threat is over (i.e., UIC ALERT).
