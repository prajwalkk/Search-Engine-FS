Through the partnerships the Study Abroad Office has with international education academic consortia, there are occasional opportunities for faculty to participate in independent individual or organized small group site visits to study abroad program centers worldwide. Sometimes these visits are heavily subsidized by the sponsoring institution. As budget resources permit, the Study Abroad Office may also be able to cost-share.
