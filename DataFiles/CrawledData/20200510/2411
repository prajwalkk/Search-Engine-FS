SysAdmins have contacted the appropriate parties to help resolve this issue. We expect this issue to be resolved by Monday, July 16, 2018.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.  Due to high temperatures, ACM/LUG services will be running in limited capacity.  The majority of servers will be powered down for the weekend to mitigate any catastrophic hardware failures.
