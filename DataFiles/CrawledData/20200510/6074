This pandemic is unlike any other in recent memory, which understandably raises many questions and concerns, and poses unexpected challenges to the functioning of an institution of higher education.  We will provide regular updates below as new developments or changes related to college operations occur.  Thank you for your support, flexibility, patience, caring and concern.  Sincerely, Creasie Finney Hairston, PhD Dean and Professor      Important Links           Important Updates for MSW Students             Response from JACSW Administration             JACSW Contingency Operations           Recent Updates Regarding College Operations   Tuesday, April 28, 2020  In line with Governor Pritzker’s extension of the stay-at-home order, college faculty and staff will continue working remotely through May 30, 2020.

This celebration is not intended to replace in-person commencement ceremonies, which will take place at a later date. Information about the in-person commencement ceremony will be provided as it becomes available.  Tuesday, April 7, 2020  In line with Governor Pritzker’s extension of the stay-at-home order, college faculty and staff will continue working remotely until April 30, 2020.       Updates in March, 2020     Updates in March, 2020         Updates in March, 2020   Friday, March 20, 2020  Governor Pritzker has issued a stay-at-home order for the state of Illinois, effective through Tuesday, April 7, 2020. Both his order and Mayor Lightfoot’s order for the city of Chicago were not done lightly and were issued to protect the health and safety of all residents, especially those at highest risk. We all know how very important it is for us to follow these orders while also carrying out many different personal and professional responsibilities. College faculty and staff are, therefore, urged to stay at home and continue working remotely, and not come to campus until notified that it is prudent to do so.  Friday, March 20, 2020  Out of an abundance of caution and concern for the health and safety of our students and of our community partners in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, field placement activities for the remainder of the spring semester are suspended and JACSW students will not return to their field placements after Spring Break . We will ensure that students’ Spring 2020 graduation will not be impacted due to the decision to suspend field placement activities.  Tuesday, March 17, 2020  In line with communications from the President of University of Illinois System, commencement ceremonies will not take place in May , as a public health precaution. Diplomas will be mailed to graduating students. The University is exploring alternative ways to honor our Spring 2020 graduates.  Monday, March 16, 2020  The health, safety, and well-being of our students remains our top priority. In line with guidance from health experts to increase the practice of social distancing to reduce the spread of COVID-19, effective Tuesday, March 17 through March 27, JACSW students’ field placement activities will be suspended and students are not to report to their field placements. Additionally, non-essential personnel have been directed to work remotely.  Saturday, March 14, 2020  In line with communications from the Chancellor of the University of Illinois at Chicago, Spring Break will begin on Monday, March 16, and is extended to a period of two weeks . Therefore, there will be no course instruction from March 16 to March 27. Classes will resume on Monday, March 30 , and will be held exclusively online for the remainder of the semester.  With regards to field instruction, in consultation with their field liaison, students and field instructors are advised to determine students’ presence in field based on agency guidelines and protocols in place to handle COVID-19, and health and safety needs.  Thursday, March 12, 2020  As a public health and safety precaution, and in line with communications from the President of the University of Illinois System and the Provost of the University of Illinois at Chicago, all Jane Addams College of Social Work classes will be conducted online beginning Monday, March 16 , at their currently scheduled days and times.  Students in field placements will continue participating in their placements as usual, and should follow the protocols established by their field instructors and field placement sites.
