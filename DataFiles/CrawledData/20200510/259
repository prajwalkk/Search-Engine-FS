I develop and apply new techniques for predicting structured data. I was awarded a Ph.D. in Machine Learning from Carnegie Mellon University in 2010.  Research:  Adversarial prediction: Approximating our training data and optimizing over the exact performance measure to provide greater flexibility for:   Learning under covariate shift (input distribution bias) and active learning;  Cost-sensitive classification and inductive optimization of univariate performance measures;  Learning to optimize for F-measure, discounted cumulative gain, and other multivariate performance measures; and  Structured prediction problems over sequences, trees, graphs, etc.   Inverse optimal control: Using maximum entropy structured prediction techniques to forecast future human behavior for intelligent robotics and vehicle navigation applications.
