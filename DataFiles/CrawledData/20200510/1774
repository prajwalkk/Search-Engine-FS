Lin’s research in its story about how U.S. Embassy workers in Cuba may have been affected by microwave weapons.  “But in a scientific paper that same month, James C. Lin of the University of Illinois, a leading investigator of the Frey effect, described the diplomatic ills as plausibly arising from microwave beams. Dr. Lin is the editor-in-chief of Bio Electro Magnetics , a peer-reviewed journal that explores the effects of radio waves and electromagnetic fields on living things.”  “In his paper, he said high-intensity beams of microwaves could have caused the diplomats to experience not just loud noises but nausea, headaches and vertigo, as well as possible brain-tissue injury. The beams, he added, could be fired covertly, hitting ‘only the intended target.’”  Read the full story: Microwave Weapons Are Prime Suspect in Ills of U.S. Embassy Workers .
