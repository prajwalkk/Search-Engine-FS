Exciting and challenging opportunities are available for capable, dedicated, and caring individuals who will be future leaders in healthcare. The University of Illinois School of Nursing was founded in 1951 and became the College of Nursing in 1959. The College of Nursing is located in close proximity to the Colleges of Applied Health Sciences, Dentistry, Medicine, Pharmacy, and the School of Public Health. The libraries and scientific and clinical resources make up one of the largest medical centers in the world.  The College of Nursing offers programs of study leading to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing; the Master of Science, the Doctor of Philosophy and the Doctor of Nursing Practice with entry at the post-baccalaureate or post-master’s level. In addition, the college offers a pre-licensure program of graduate study leading to a Master of Science degree in nursing. The Graduate Entry Master of Science program is specifically designed for students who hold baccalaureate degrees in other fields and want to pursue a master’s degree in nursing. In addition to the Chicago campus, the college has five regional sites within the state: Peoria, Quad Cities, Rockford, Springfield, and Urbana. The traditional Bachelor of Science in Nursing program is offered at the Chicago, Springfield, and Urbana sites. The graduate entry master’s program is offered at the Chicago and Urbana sites. The PhD program is offered only at the Chicago site. The Master of Science and Doctor of Nursing Practice are offered at all sites. The RN to BSN program is offered online through UIC Extended Campus.  Undergraduate Study in Nursing  The College of Nursing undergraduate program leads to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The curriculum is divided into three levels: foundation, middle, and terminal. The foundation level, freshman and sophomore years, includes those lower-division non-nursing courses that represent the basic learning necessary for the completion of the course of study. The middle level, junior year, includes most upper-division courses that prepare the graduate as a nurse generalist. The terminal level, senior year, represents those upper-division, senior-level courses at the end of the nursing program that synthesize previous learning.  The Bachelor of Science in Nursing provides students with the basic nursing preparation and eligibility to apply for the National Council Licensure Exam for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN). For students who are already licensed registered nurses and wish to further their education, the college offers an RN to BSN completion program (offered through UIC Extended Campus).  Accreditation  College of Nursing programs are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) and approved by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR). The college holds membership in the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN).  Admissions  Applications to the BSN program are accepted for fall admission only. Students are admitted to the college in one of four ways:   intercollege transfer student;  transfer student; or  Guaranteed Professional Program Admissions (GPPA) student. Information on the application process and deadlines can be found on the GPPA website .  Dual Admission between contracted ADN degree programs and UIC College of Nursing   Applications to the RN/BSN program are accepted year-round; information on the application process and deadlines can be found on the College of Nursing website .  Applications to Dual Admission are specific to certain contractual partnerships with a variety of community colleges. Information on the application process and deadlines can be found on the College of Nursing website.  Admission Requirements  Students applying to the BSN program must meet the following minimum requirements:   2.75/4.00 cumulative transfer grade point average at application deadline  2.50/4.00 natural science grade point average at application deadline  Completion of all pre-nursing course work (see Course Requirements—Pre-Nursing Studies ) with a grade of C or higher prior to enrollment. Applicants must have all BSN prerequisite courses, with the exception of the Upper Division Elective prerequisite, completed by the end of the spring semester before the start of the program.  The five natural science courses (human anatomy and physiology I and II, microbiology, general chemistry, and organic chemistry/biochemistry) must be completed by the end of the spring semester before the start of the program and must have been completed within seven years of enrollment.   Pre-nursing course work can be completed at UIC or at another college or university. Applicants can view information about course equivalencies and how courses transfer to UIC and the College of Nursing through Transferology . See the Office of Admission Transfer Guide for more information about transfer admission requirements.  In addition, all students will be required to have a background check and drug test upon admission. If the results of either requirement indicate that a student would not be eligible for placement at the college’s practicum agencies, the student’s admission will be rescinded.  RN to BSN Program  Students applying to the RN to BSN program must meet the following minimum requirements:   A 2.50/4.00 cumulative transfer grade point average  Current U.S. RN license. Students who apply for admission directly from an ADN or nursing diploma program must take the NCLEX after graduation and present the RN license to the college by the end of the first semester. Failure to pass the NCLEX-RN examination and/or present a current U.S. RN license will result in the student not being able to progress beyond the first semester of the program, until passing scores are provided.   Students who have graduated from a state-approved associate’s degree in nursing (ADN) program and who hold a current license as registered professional nurse will receive 33 semester hours of proficiency credit. The credit will be awarded upon successful completion of 8 nursing semester hours in the RN to BSN program.  DA ADN + BSN Pathway Program  Students applying to the DA ADN + BSN program must meet the following minimum requirements:   Enrollment at a community college specified and contracted for DA ADN + BSN  Enrollment in pre-nursing or nursing degree as defined by the contract with the community college  A minimum 2.50/4.00 cumulative transfer GPA  Completion of a UIC College of Nursing RN to BSN program application   Students enrolled in the DA ADN + BSN program must meet the following minimum requirements in order to graduate:   Graduation from a state-approved associate degree in nursing (ADN) program which has contracted with UIC for DA ADN + BSN  An active U.S. registered nurse license  Completion of 57 semester hours of non-nursing courses, including UIC general education  course requirements with a grade of C or higher  Completion of 33 UIC nursing proficiency credits  Completion of 30 hours in the UIC College of Nursing BSN Completion Degree with grade of C or higher  Compliance with UIC and UIC College of Nursing undergraduate student graduation requirements as indicated in university catalogs and student handbooks   Upon graduation from the contracted associate degree program, dual admission in both institutions ends and the students remains a UIC College of Nursing student only. However, the student must take the NCLEX-RN licensure examination as a graduate of the community college ADN degree program and present proof of exam passage and RN license to UIC College of Nursing by the end of the first semester of BSN-level-only courses. Failure to pass the NCLEX-RN examination and/or present a current U.S. RN license will result in the student not being able to progress beyond the first semester of the BSN completion program until passing scores and U.S. RN licensure are provided.  Students who have graduated from a state-approved associate degree in nursing (ADN) program contracted with UIC for DA ADN + BSN and who hold a current license as a registered professional nurse will receive 33 semester hours of proficiency credit. The credit will be awarded upon successful completion of 8 semester hours of the UIC BSN completion degree.  First Year Student Admissions  The College of Nursing does not admit first year students to the BSN program because two years of college level prerequisite courses are required. Although those seeking admission to UIC as first year students may apply to any college at the university, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences provides an advising track for students interested in health professions.  Students can list Pre-Nursing as their educational goal. Those seeking admission to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) as first year students should apply to either the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences or the College of Applied Health Sciences, both of which provide an advising track for students interested in several health professions. More information on admission to UIUC can be found online. Those seeking admission to the University of Illinois at Springfield as first year students should apply through the UIS website.  Guaranteed Professional Program Admissions (GPPA)  The Guaranteed Professional Program Admissions (GPPA) gives academically talented freshman applicants the opportunity to be admitted to UIC with admission guaranteed to the College of Nursing BSN program if undergraduate course and performance criteria are met. For more information, please see the Guaranteed Professional Program Admissions information in the Admissions section of this catalog.  Degree Requirements  To earn the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree from UIC, students need to complete the degree requirements of the university and college that are in effect at the time of initial registration. It is essential for each student to become familiar with the degree requirements stated in this catalog and to keep up-to-date with published changes. If requirements change, continuing students and those whose attendance at UIC has been interrupted for no more than two years may elect to complete the new graduation requirements or may continue to fulfill those requirements in effect at the time of initial registration. Students who return to UIC after an absence of more than two years are responsible for meeting the requirements of the university and college in effect at the time of reenrollment. If courses originally required are no longer offered, the college has the prerogative of specifying substitutes.  Note: The college retains the right to change educational policy and graduation requirements at any time. This may affect currently enrolled students’ standing.  Semester Hour Requirement  The College of Nursing semester hour requirement for graduation is 120 semester hours. UIC students complete the first two years of the program in Pre-Nursing Studies through the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. If admitted to the College of Nursing, students complete the final two years in the Nursing curriculum. See Preprofessional Studies in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences section of the catalog for more information on Pre-Nursing.   UG Public Health Semester Hour Requirement     Degree Program  Degree Conferred  Total Hours     Nursing  BS in Nursing  120     Course Requirements  See the BS in Nursing page for Course Requirements.  General Education Core  General Education at UIC is designed to serve as a foundation for lifelong learning. As outlined in the Pre-Nursing Studies course list, College of Nursing students meet the university’s General Education Core requirement of a minimum of 24 semester hours in the General Education Core with at least one course from each of the following categories:   Analyzing the Natural World  Understanding the Individual and Society  Understanding the Past  Understanding the Creative Arts  Exploring World Cultures  Understanding U.S. Society   For a description and a list of courses for each General Education Core category, students should consult the General Education section of the catalog.  General Education Proficiencies—University Writing Requirement  As noted in the Pre-Nursing Studies course list, College of Nursing students meet the requirement by achieving a passing grade in ENGL 160 and ENGL 161 .  Other Requirements  Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement  All students are required to satisfactorily complete with a minimum grade of C all required LAS and nursing courses and maintain a cumulative and nursing grade point average of at least 2.00/4.00.  Graduation Declaration/Filing to Graduate  Students declare their intent to graduate online using my.UIC .edu . The deadline for submission to the Pending Degree List is the end of the third week (fall and spring) or second week (Summer Session 2) of the term in which graduation is sought. Failure to submit the request at this time may delay the awarding of the degree. A final review will be made following the close of the term. If a student has satisfactorily completed all the degree requirements, the student’s name will be placed on the official degree list.  Enrollment Residence Requirement  At a minimum, the last 30 semester hours of university work must be taken at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Concurrent attendance at the University of Illinois at Chicago and another collegiate institution or enrollment during the summer at another institution, when approved by the student’s college, does not interrupt the UIC enrollment residence requirement for graduation.  College Policies  Academic Load  To be considered full-time, a student must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 semester hours fall and spring terms. During the regular academic year, an academic course load exceeding 18 semester hours must be approved in the College Office of Academic Programs.  Academic Probation and Dismissal Rules  Probation Rules  A cumulative grade point average is calculated. When the nursing or cumulative grade point average is below 2.00/4.00, the student is placed on probation.  A student not currently on academic probation will be placed on academic probation at the end of any term in which the student earns less than a 2.00/4.00 in nursing, non-nursing, or cumulative grade point average.  A student currently on academic probation will be continued on academic probation when:   The student meets the grade point average required by the conditions of his or her probation but does not raise the cumulative UIC grade point average to at least 2.00/4.00; or  The student meets the grade point average required by the conditions of his or her probation but does not raise the combined average of the student’s transfer and UIC course work to at least 2.00/4.00.   The Undergraduate Admissions and Academic Standards Committee determines the conditions of probation. In addition to specifying the grade point average, the committee may require the completion of specific courses, may limit the number or hours for which the student registers, and may exclude the student from taking certain courses while on probation.  Dismissal Rules   A student on academic probation will be dismissed in any term in which the student fails to meet the grade point average required by the probation and in which the cumulative grade point average in courses taken at UIC is less than 2.00/4.00.  A student on academic probation will be dismissed in any term in which the student fails to meet the grade point average required by the probation and in which the combined transfer and UIC grade point average is less than 2.00/4.00.  A student who fails to make progress toward a degree may be dismissed. Examples include failure to complete required courses, accumulation of an excessive number of Incomplete grades, failure to earn credit in any semester, failure to maintain a C average in nursing.  Students may not earn more than one grade below C in nursing courses during the entire academic program, in either the same or two different nursing courses. When a student receives a second grade below C in a nursing course, the student will be dismissed from the college, withdrawn for academic failure.  Students dismissed from the college will also be dismissed from the university.   Change of Course Schedule—Dropping Courses  Undergraduate students may drop courses using my.UIC.edu through the end of the second week of classes for fall and spring semesters, the first Wednesday of Summer Session 1, or the first Friday of Summer Session 2. During weeks 3 through 10 of the fall and spring semesters (first Thursday through the second Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or weeks 2 through 5 of Summer Session 2), students may drop courses with the permission of their major college. If the drop occurs between 0 and 2 weeks in fall and spring, there will be no notation on the transcript. If the drop occurs during weeks 3 through 10 in fall and spring (first Thursday through the second Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or weeks 2 through 5 of Summer Session 2), a W is noted on the transcript. Undergraduate students may drop a maximum of 4 UIC individual courses that result in a W notation on their transcript during their entire undergraduate degree program.  College of Nursing students who wish to make changes to their registration must first meet with their academic advisor.  Class Attendance  Classroom  Attendance at all classroom sessions is expected. Students are expected to prepare for each class by completing the required readings and other assignments.  Discussion Groups  Discussion groups are a critical component of many courses. Attendance and participation are expected. Attendance will be taken during discussion group times to assure participation. If the student is unable to attend discussion group due to an accident, illness, or injury, the student must contact the course coordinator to make up any work that is missed.  Laboratory Sessions  Attendance at all laboratory sessions is expected. In the event that a student misses a laboratory session due to illness or personal emergency, the student will make arrangements to complete the session and the assigned exercise. Failure to do so will result in the student’s grade being lowered, and the student may not be able to progress to the next lab session until the make-up is completed.  Practicum Sessions  Practicum attendance is required. Students must be prepared for the practicum experience. If a faculty member determines that the student is not prepared to participate fully in the practicum experience, the faculty member may ask the student to leave or not to participate in certain activities. The student’s performance for the day will be considered unsatisfactory and will influence the practicum evaluation. If written assignments are required, a grade of zero will be given. In the event of illness or a personal emergency, students must notify the practicum instructor per the instructions in the course syllabus. Students who miss more than 15% of a course’s total practicum hours, regardless of their level of performance otherwise, may be required to repeat that course before progressing in the program.  Students must attend all practicum orientations for their assigned agency. If students are not present, they will not be allowed to continue in the course. Opportunities for making up orientation absences are not available. Any absence may affect the grade.  Petition Procedure  Students may petition the college’s Associate Dean for Academic Affairs for exceptions to certain college regulations, but should do so only after consulting with their advisor, whose recommendations must appear on the petition. Petition forms may be obtained in the Office of Academic Programs. Petition forms must be accompanied by a full explanation of the circumstances and any appropriate supporting documents. Petitions should be filed within thirty (30) days of the time an individual knows, or reasonably should have known, that an occurrence has affected his or her status. Petitions can take 4–6 weeks to be reviewed and a decision made.  Registration Approval  The College of Nursing has a mandatory advising policy. Before registering for courses each semester, students must meet with their advisor to discuss their degree plan and to clear their advising hold.  Repeat Policy for Standard Graded Courses  If a student does not receive a C grade or higher in a nursing course, the student is required to repeat the course. A student may repeat a nursing course or its equivalent only once. If a grade of C or higher is not earned at the end of the second registration in a nursing course or its equivalent, the student will be dismissed from the college.  A nonclinical nursing course in which a grade below C is received must be repeated the first term the course is offered again.  The original grade for the course and the grade for each repeat will appear on the transcript. The original grade and the grade for each repeat will be calculated into the grade point average. Only one registration for the course counts toward the total number of credits required for graduation. A course cannot be repeated after receiving credit in a course for which the repeat course is a prerequisite.  Undergraduate Grade Point Average Recalculation Policy   Colleges may elect to implement this policy as early as the end of the junior year, or as late as the final semester during degree certification.  The college will evaluate each student unable to graduate because of an academic grade point average deficit. The deficit may occur in the UIC GPA, the program GPA, or both.  The academic record is examined so as to determine if courses, deemed appropriate by each college, with grades of F or grades of D, may be excluded from the student’s grade point average.  A total of four courses may be excluded, with one course excluded at a time until the necessary quality points are obtained to meet the UIC GPA requirement and/or degree program minimum GPA. The semester hours associated with excluded course grades will not count towards graduation requirements.  Only the college can initiate course exclusions, and only in consultation with the evaluated student.  Students may not request exclusions.  Only courses taken at UIC may be converted as part of this policy.  This policy only applies to undergraduate degree seeking students.  All courses taken and all grades will remain on the official transcript.  The grade exclusion policy does not apply to courses failed as the result of a student conduct hearing.  In cases where these procedures would impact program accreditation, licensure or similar, colleges may use their discretion to allow the policy. Colleges, departments, and programs may have discretion in choosing courses that impact the student’s major.   Transferring  Intercollege Transfer Students  See previous section on Admissions .  Transfer Students from Other Colleges and Universities  See previous section on Admissions .  Requirements for All Students  Accommodation  Students requesting an accommodation for disabilities should contact the Disability Resource Center at (312) 413-2183 (voice) or (312) 413-0123 (TTY only) or visit the Disability Resource Center website .  The Disability Resource Center will evaluate the student’s request and make recommendations to the College of Nursing. The college will determine if the recommendations can be met. No accommodations can be made until the student’s situation is evaluated by the Disability Resource Center.  Alcohol and Controlled Substances  The use of alcohol and illegal use of controlled substances, including alcohol, can seriously injure the health of students, impair their performance of their responsibilities, and endanger the safety and well-being of fellow students and members of the general public. Students who are engaged in clinical work at a practicum site may be required to submit to random tests for illegal use of controlled substances as provided by the law or regulations of the contracting agency. Just cause for student disciplinary action includes, but is not limited to, use or unauthorized possession of intoxicants, controlled or illegal substances, or materials dangerous to public health and safety. It is not acceptable to use alcohol or illegal drugs prior to or during class or clinical. Immediate disciplinary action will be taken.  Background Check and Drug Testing  All students will be required to have a background check and drug test upon admission. If the results of either requirement indicate that the student would not be eligible for placement at the college’s practicum agencies, the student’s admission will be rescinded. Students may be required to repeat either requirement should the practicum agency require more frequent testing. If at any time during the period of enrollment, the student’s background check or drug test results preclude placement in a practicum agency, the student will be required to withdraw from the program. At time of application for licensure, students will be required to submit to fingerprinting and be reviewed for eligibility by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR).  Citizenship  Undocumented students are eligible to sit for licensure at time of graduation. However, the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) requires resolution of the citizenship status within two years from date of initial licensure.  CPR Certification  Students must hold current CPR certification prior to enrolling in their first practicum course. Certification must be at the level of professional or healthcare worker rescuer, which includes the use of the AED, one- and two-man rescues for all ages, cricoid pressure, and the use of external inhalation devices. Students who do not provide this documentation will not be allowed to participate in practicum experiences.  Immunization  Students must document proof of immunity to register for courses and participate in clinical experiences. Upon admission, students will need to comply with all clinical compliance requirements found in the College of Nursing Student Handbook . Students who do not provide this documentation will not be allowed to participate in practicum experiences. Students are required to keep all immunizations current throughout their enrollment.  Transportation  Each student is responsible for his or her own transportation to all practicum sites. These sites may be located some distance from the College of Nursing and public transportation may not always be available. Therefore, students need a car. Students without a car will need to find alternative methods of transportation.  Academic Advising  Advising Policy  Prior to admission to the College of Nursing, prospective students should contact the UIC Office of Admissions regarding advice on acceptance of transfer credit. Following admission, students are assigned an advisor within the College of Nursing who will assist them with course and career planning. Mandatory advising is required each term.  Academic Honors  College Honors  At commencement, students are awarded College Honors for academic distinction. College Honors shall be awarded to the top 15% of students based on their nursing grade point average. Students will be awarded an Honor Cord. Graduation with College Honors benefits students when they are being considered for job placement, graduate school, and other competitive opportunities.  Sigma Theta Tau  The College of Nursing has the Alpha Lambda chapter of Sigma Theta Tau, the International Honor Society in Nursing. The purposes of the society are to recognize achievement of superior scholarship and the development of leadership qualities, foster high professional standards, encourage creative work, and strengthen the commitment by individuals to the ideals and purposes of the profession of nursing. Seniors and graduate students are eligible for membership.   Degree Programs   BS in Nursing  RN/BSN Completion Program       NURS 202.  Concepts and Processes of Professional Nursing.  3 hours.
