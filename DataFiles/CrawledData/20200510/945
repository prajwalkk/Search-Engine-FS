The IRD provides a venue for students at UIC to present their research and other scholarly pursuits and discuss the impact of those experiences.  Students from all disciplines (Arts, Business, Computer Science, Engineering, Humanities, Life Sciences, Mathematics, Physical Sciences, Social Sciences, among others) are invited to present in one of four formats:  a research poster, an impact poster or display, a 10-minute oral presentation, or a creative presentation.  Research presentations and impact posters are accompanied by a poster or other visual display that captures the spirit of the research work and/or highlights key features of the project while creative presentations could include a recital or art display.  Oral presentations will focus on an engagement experience.  Each format will be judged by a mix of faculty and alumni judges during a high-energy, 3-hour session.  For those students enrolled in the Honors College, each of these formats will meet capstone requirements.  Monetary awards will be given in various categories.   More information on each category including the requirements for each category can be found here .
