This event takes place in the CS lounge, where both students and professors are placed into teams. Each member in the team are at a different level depending on what computer science courses they have taken (1xx, 2xx, 3xx, & 4xx courses) with one professor per team. They are given a set of problems to solve & find throughout the UIC’s west campus.  There’s food, friendships, and a great time! Our scavenger hunt this fall semester was a success. Thank you for everyone who made this a successful event.      2019 Fall Scavenger Hunt       Go to slide 1    Go to slide 2    Go to slide 3    Go to slide 4    Go to slide 5    Go to slide 6    Go to slide 7                Go to the next slide    Go to the previous slide                 Go to the next slide    Go to the previous slide                 Go to the next slide    Go to the previous slide                 Go to the next slide    Go to the previous slide                 Go to the next slide    Go to the previous slide                 Go to the next slide    Go to the previous slide                 Go to the next slide    Go to the previous slide                  Events    Back to main content           Calendar                  UIC Logo        Student Organizations    This website is produced and managed by an offical UIC student organization.
