DEADLINES FOR APPLICANTS   November 1, 2019 – Deadline for all GPPA programs.  May 1, 2020 – Intent to Enroll deadline for student acceptance of UIC and GPPA   Applications must be completed by the stated deadline.  The application deadline is Midnight Eastern time (11pm Central) on the posted deadline date. Applicants are encouraged to submit their materials well in advance of the deadline. Submitting applications during business hours is also recommended so any technical issues can be addressed in a timely manner.  A complete application includes the materials submitted via the Common Application, transcripts, and official test scores. Letters of recommendation may be submitted via the Common Application or sent directly to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions:  Office of Undergraduate Admissions (MC 108) University of Illinois at Chicago 1200 West Harrison Street, Suite 1100 Chicago, IL 60607-7161  It is preferred that letters of recommendation are submitted via the Common Application if possible. Letters of recommendation postmarked by the application deadline will be accepted but applicants are recommended to have all letters submitted earlier.

March 1, 2020 – GPPA Applicants will be informed of their admission decision on or before this date.   THE GPPA APPLICATION  A complete GPPA Application consists of three parts:   COMMON APPLICATION – Submit a completed Common Application along with the UIC Supplement.  GPPA & HONORS COLLEGE ESSAYS – In the “Questions” tab of the UIC Members page within the Common Application there is a “GPPA and Honors College” section where applications to GPPA and to the Honors College are submitted. Applicants submit essay(s) in this section.  For GPPA: Complete the GPPA Application Statement.  (400 – 500 word limit) GPPA Statement: By applying to the GPPA programs, you are applying for a guaranteed seat in one of UIC’s graduate and professional programs earlier than students who apply in a traditional manner. The GPPA program seeks to understand why you have chosen your intended profession and a guaranteed path into it.  What makes you an ideal candidate for guaranteed admission rather than following a traditional path to your intended profession?  How would a guaranteed seat contribute to your goals as an undergraduate?  For programs that require Honors College membership (Accounting, Dentistry, Kinesiology, Law, Management Information Systems, Medicine, Nursing, Nutrition, Pharmacy) complete the Honors College Statement. All other programs highly recommend membership in the Honors College (400 – 500 word limit)  Honors College Statement: How will your engagement with the Honors College foster your academic, personal, and professional growth?    TWO LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION – Submit two (2) letters of recommendation to UIC.  You are only required to submit two letters. The maximum is four, but you should prioritize quality over quantity and only ask those who genuinely know you.  Letters should be from people who can attest to the applicant’s academic and professional capabilities – family members are not acceptable sources.  Letters of recommendation can be submitted electronically via the Common Application system or directly to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.  The same letters will be considered for both the Honors College and GPPA. The admission committees for both programs will have access to all parts of your UIC application and can therefore review the same letters.  Letters should address the following criteria for a candidate: “Please provide, using specific examples where possible, evidence of this student’s particular intellectual strengths and weaknesses. What distinguishes this student?”  The selection committees prefer that recommenders address the student’s experience in the following areas as observed: academic ability, motivation, intellectual curiosity, maturity, responsibility, written expression of ideas, and research aptitude.  School Counselor Evaluation forms may also be accepted as a letter of recommendation.     NOTES TO APPLICANTS   You may only apply to one GPPA program.  You must be a first year applicant.  This does exclude transfer applicants.  Application to GPPA is competitive. The most successful applicants have a 28 ACT Composite or SAT Equivalent 1310 or higher. We do not ask for the writing sections of either test and we do not consider SAT Subject tests. Most successful applicants are in the top 15% of their high school class, but this is not required to apply.    Two of the GPPA programs have residency requirements:  Applicants to the programs in Medicine and Dentistry must be residents of Illinois and US Citizens or Permanent Residents.    All applicants to the Biomedical Visualization program must submit a portfolio. To determine what their portfolio should obtain, applicants should contact John Daugherty at jdaug@uic.edu .  International or domestic students with international credentials may be required to submit additional materials  GPPA is a self-managed application process. The applicant is asked to collect and return all required materials. Please note that letters of recommendation will be accepted if mailed by the recommenders or school, but this is not the preferred method and can cause materials to arrive beyond the deadline. It is the applicant’s responsibility to ensure the submission of all required application materials by the stated deadline.
