The Department of Psychology is committed to recruiting, retaining, and supporting diversity among its undergraduate students and majors, graduate students, faculty, and staff.  Implementing this mission  Building upon the Psychology Department’s commitment to diversity, the Diversity Advancement Committee (DAC) is committed to help create and sustain an inclusive environment where individuals from different backgrounds are valued, respected, and supported. We believe that the diversity of our people, worldviews, and ideas are essential to fostering and sustaining intellectual excellence in our Department.
