Thesis Manual         ETD Format     Title Page         Title Page   The format of the title page for an ETD should include the names and roles of the defense committee.

Sample ETD title pages (Word)  [committee names and other information in samples are fictional]:   Master’s (3 member committee) Sample A, chair & advisor same person, outside member from UIC Master’s (3 member committee) Sample B, chair & advisor different people, no outside member Doctoral (5 member committee) Sample C, chair & advisor same person, one outside member from UIC and one outside member from another institution Doctoral (5 member committee) Sample D, chair and advisor different people, one outside member from UIC and one outside member from another institution     Master's (3 member committee) Sample A    Master's (3 member committee) Sample B    Doctoral (5 member committee) Sample C    Doctoral (5 member committee) Sample D          Other Preliminary Pages         Other Preliminary Pages   All other preliminary pages (following the title page, technically page “i”) should be numbered accordingly, using lower case Roman numerals. The order should follow the Thesis Manual.        Abstract and Key Words         Abstract and Key Words    All ETD submissions require a separate abstract. This applies to master’s theses and doctoral dissertations. The abstract is not included within the thesis/dissertation.  With ETD submissions, a separate paper copy of the abstract is not required. Students, however, must paste an abstract (recommended 350 word maximum, but may be longer) in the text box provided as part of the online submission process.  Another text box during the submission process requires that keywords related to your document for search purposes be included.         Uploaded Files         Uploaded Files    The document must be converted and submitted as a single Portable Document File (PDF).  The PDF file must be named Lastname_Firstname.pdf (no spaces), where “Last(family)name and “First(given)name are that of the student.  Security settings should not be applied to the PDF file.  The PDF file should not contain embedded multimedia.  In addition to the PDF you may submit the original format file of the document (Word, LaTex, etc.). This is recommended for the UIC Library to use as source material in the event the PDF is corrupted or not readable in the future.  Finally, you may upload supplementary appendix files such as audio, video or data sets. If the supplementary material is text and can be converted to PDF as part of your main document, it is recommended that they be included as an appendix within the ETD rather than as supplementary files.
