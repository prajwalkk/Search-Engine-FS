The mission of the division of clinical psychology is to educate innovative research-oriented scholars. Following the Boulder Model/scientist-practitioner approach to training, we emphasize the integration of research and clinical work to produce leading researchers who will advance theory, research, and application in the areas of assessment, treatment, and the prevention of psychopathology. Within this context, practicum training provides experiences that enable students to learn evidenced based assessment and treatment approaches, as well as strategies for the prevention of behavioral problems and the promotion of health. Our educational philosophy emphasizes a scientific and socially responsible approach to clinical psychology, including a sensitivity to ethical issues as well as gender, ethnic, and cultural diversity. Whereas we offer intensive and rich clinical training experiences to our doctoral students, we do not aim to train students for careers in private practice or full-time service delivery. Consistent with this philosophy, our program is also a member of the Academy of Psychological Clinical Science .  Our program espouses a mentorship model of training emphasizing intensive individual attention. Opportunities exist for research, training, and collaboration in health psychology, prevention, statistics, psychology and law, addictive behaviors, adult and adolescent psychopathology, and school-family programming to promote children’s social, emotional, and academic learning. Also, there are opportunities for research on issues including psychotic disorders, autism, mood and anxiety disorders, treatment outcome, smoking cessation, and HIV/AIDS. Clinical faculty members and clinical affiliates utilize a range of exciting and state-of-the-art research methods, including psychophysiological assessment, ecological momentary assessment, fMRI, PET, eye movement studies, randomized clinical trials, and longitudinal designs, to name but a few. Participant research samples are also diverse in nature across studies, including nicotine dependent adolescents and adults, clinical samples, including those with major psychotic disorders, major depression, anxiety disorders, patients with HIV/AIDS, and preschool to high school students and teachers in urban and suburban schools.  The UIC Department of Psychology maintains an outpatient clinic called the Office of Applied Psychological Services (OAPS) . OAPS functions as a training, research, and service facility; clinical students conduct diagnostic psychological assessment and individual or group therapy, under the supervision of licensed clinical psychologists. We espouse an evidence-based practice approach to the training of clinical scientists. As such, we provide clinical training opportunities in psychological treatments that have received ample empirical scrutiny and support. Subsequent to training at OAPS, clinical skills continue to be acquired through supervised practica in a wide variety of settings, both on and off campus.  We emphasize and value transdisciplinary approaches to the study of clinical science and actively promote collaborative approaches to research. As such, our students have access to a wide variety of research and clinical facilities both within and outside the Department of Psychology. These include UIC Center for Cognitive Medicine, the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL), UIC Institute for Juvenile Research, UIC Department of Psychiatry, UIC's affiliated programs on developmental disabilities. Rush University Medical Center, Jesse Brown VA Hospital, Edward Hines Jr. VA hospital, and University of Chicago Department of Psychiatry.   Additional facilities throughout the Chicago area include several community mental health centers, community organizations, other university-based hospitals and clinics, and private hospitals and clinics.  We select students who have the greatest potential for, and commitment to careers as research oriented scientist-practitioners. In addition to strong records of academic achievement, reflected in high undergraduate GPAs and GREs, we look for a record of research accomplishments and a demonstrated commitment to pursue careers in research settings. Further, we attempt to recruit an incoming class that is geographically and culturally diverse. In addition, we select students who have interests in the content areas that match the research themes represented among the Clinical faculty. We invite 10-20 of the most highly qualified applicants to a Department-wide Visitation Day which includes meetings with current students, prospective advisors, and other faculty. The program also includes presentations on faculty research as well as an overview of the curriculum, a tour of the clinic, and a lunch meeting with current students. The purpose of the interview event is for applicants to become clearly aware of our program's goals and expectations and for faculty to assess the likely promise of the applicants and their match to the program. The 'Student Characteristics' link (see left navigation bar under the Clinical Division) provides information regarding numbers of applications and GRE scores of current students.  The Clinical program has been APA accredited continuously since 1974.Questions regarding accreditation may be addressed to the Directors of Clinical Training, Ellen Herbener, PhD, ( herbener@uic.edu ).  Further questions regarding the accreditation status of the Clinical Psychology Area may be directed in writing to the Office of Program Consultation and Accreditation of the American Psychological Association, 750 First Street NE, Washington, DC 20002 or by telephone to (202) 336-5979.
