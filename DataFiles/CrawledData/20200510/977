Research Informatics Core  The Research Informatics Core (RIC) at the University of Illinois-Chicago (UIC) provides advanced computing and statistical expertise to support the analytic activities related to genetics, genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metagenomics, metabolomics, and proteomics for the UIC and Chicago-area research community, as well as supporting and coordinating inter-disciplinary research initiatives. RIC aids researchers with the management, integration, and contextual analysis of data, provides training on tools, databases, and best practices, and supports grant activities.
