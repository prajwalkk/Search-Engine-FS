TRANSCRIPTS  We understand that from the viewpoint of many countries, the word “transcript” is an American term. When the Office of Admissions asks you for transcripts, we are actually asking for a copy of your academic record which includes courses taken, course descriptions, credits earned or hours completed, and posted grades. The following academic records are always acceptable as “transcripts”:  Bosnia & Herzegovina - Index or Upsinica  Croatia - Indeks or Uvjerjenje  Germany - Scheinen or Student Reported Summary which has been certified by the university  Poland - Indeks  India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka - See Marksheets below  Countries following the Bologna Agreement - Transcripts. A diploma supplement may also be required.  MARKSHEETS  Some institutions (such as those in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka) provide a separate sheet for each year or semester which details the classes taken and marks achieved by a student. The following criteria are applied when the Office of Admissions reviews these credentials:  Marksheets provided should be issued on a yearly or semesterly basis. These should be unconsolidated. Consolidated marks will not be accepted.  All yearly or semesterly marksheets should be combined into a single PDF for upload.  All examination attempts, including failures, must be included.   Marks secured, minimum passing marks, and maximum marks should be shown.  Marksheets may be issued by the university or the college. University marksheets are preferred over college transcripts, however, if the college credentials contain all the necessary information, they will be sufficient.   Marksheets should clearly list the course names. If all that is shown is Paper I, II, and III or Exams I, II, III for a certain subject, the Office of Admissions will ask for a syllabus or course descriptions.   Always provide the back of the marksheets if any information regarding courses or grading policies is listed on it.  DEGREE CERTIFICATE/DIPLOMA - PROOF OF DEGREE  The Office of Admissions requires proof of all degrees that a student has earned. This should be a copy of your diploma or degree award certificate. It should state the type of degree you were awarded, the fact that it was granted to you, and the date of conferment. See below for information on types of certificates accepted as proof of degree.  Unacceptable proofs of degree:  Certificates which indicate only the passing of an examination or semester Exam Certificates, Final Exam Certificates, Pass Certificates, Degree Exam Certificates   Certificates or statements issued by the college or a college official. Proof of degree must be issued by the university which has the authority to grant the degree.   Acceptable proofs of degree:  A copy of the conferred degree award certificates or diploma, issued by the university.  A Provisional Degree Certificate, issued by the university Provisional certificates must indicate that you have qualified for the degree and that it will be conferred at a future date.   CERTIFIED TRANSLATIONS  The Office of Admissions requires literal, certified translations for all documents issued in a language other than English.  When not officially provided by your prior university, we accept translations from the following:  ATA certified translators  translation agencies  court-appointed translators  the consulate  Translations should be on a translator’s letterhead and should be literal (not an interpretation or a paraphrasing).  Plain translations, notarized translations, and translations done by someone other than a certified translator are not acceptable. Evaluations performed by agencies such as WES and ECE will not be used in place of certified translations.  DIPLOMA SUPPLEMENT  The supplement provides a description of the nature, level, context and status of the studies a student pursued and successfully completed.  SYLLABUS/COURSE DESCRIPTIONS  Applicants may be required to submit a syllabus or course descriptions if an academic credential does not provide enough detail about the courses taken. These items will usually provide a key for understanding the courses you have taken and will provide the highlights of that course's curriculum. These will be requested on a case-by-case basis.      English Proficiency Valid English proficiency test scores must be submitted if required, based on the country or territory in which an applicant previously studied. Refer to the requirements for your country/territory above.  The following are the only tests accepted at UIC as evidence of English proficiency. The Graduate College minimum scores* are indicated for each.

REQUIREMENT EXEMPTIONS  The English proficiency test requirement may be waived under the following circumstances, if the conditions have occurred within the last five years:  Enrollment at a U.S. institution for at least two years of full-time study. Exemptions based upon enrollment will be applied after receipt of applicable academic credentials.   Employment in the U.S. for at least one year on a full-time basis. Documentation for exemptions based upon employment will be requested to be uploaded through the application checklist after submission of the application.  It should consist of a letter from your employer issued on letterhead which indicates the length of time you have been employed at the establishment and attests to your proficiency with the English language.   Education or employment for the duration of time listed above in a country or territory from which an English proficiency test is not required.  English proficiency requirements are not waived based upon the medium of instruction at a previously attended institution. This includes attendance at a branch or campus of a US or UK institution which is physically located in a country or territory from which an English proficiency test is required.  TUTORIUM IN INTENSIVE ENGLISH OPTION  In certain cases where an applicant presents a strong academic profile but has sub-standard English proficiency test scores, the admitting program can offer the opportunity to enroll in an intensive English program prior to beginning study in the degree program. This is known as the Tutorium in Intensive English program (TIE). Note that this option is offered at the discretion of the admitting program. Programs may choose not to offer admission to the TIE.  Applicants must still follow the standard application procedure and submit all requirements, including valid English proficiency test scores. UIC does not offer the option to defer submission of valid English proficiency test scores.  The Tutorium in Intensive English (TIE) coordinates UIC’s intensive English instruction. Students enrolled in only intensive English instruction pay UIC fees and assessments for campus services and TIE tuition . As students transition to UIC standard instruction, students pay UIC tuition proportionate to the credit hours taken in standard UIC classes.  ENGLISH LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT FOR ASSISTANTSHIPS  UIC has a separate policy and English language assessment for admitted students who are offered assistantships. Under the Graduate College, the International Teaching Assistant Program (ITAP) administers the Oral Certification Interview (OCI) for prospective Teaching Assistants. Click here for information about the Illinois state law and UIC's policy on the spoken English requirements for non-native English-speaking Teaching Assistants.

More information on financial support can be found on the Graduate College website .  Contact your intended program to see what funding opportunities are available and whether you are being offered funding.      Visa Process for Admitted Students Financial documents for visa processing are requested by the Office of International Services. Applicants may begin submitting OIS-requested documents online through the application system checklist during the application period, however, they do not need to be submitted until after an admission decision is made.  OIS document requests and visa processing do not affect application review or admission decisions.  Please see the website of the Office of International Services for additional details and contact them with inquiries about OIS document requests or financial documents you've submitted.      Official Credential Guidelines Only admitted applicants who intend to enroll at UIC will be required to submit official, attested and sealed copies of their academic credentials to the Office of Admissions before they can register for their second semester at UIC. This includes both the transcripts or marksheets and the degree certificate/diploma.  If English translations were required, the original translations should also be submitted.  From foreign institutions, copies of original credentials which have been attested by the university or college authority and sealed by the same individual will be considered as official. We understand that many universities only issue one set of final, original credentials. Please do not send originals to UIC, as received documents cannot be returned.  Attestation:  Make a copy of your transcripts or marksheets and degree.  Have them stamped/attested by the university or college authority.  Each page should be individually attested.  Acceptable attestation authorities include: Registrar (Assistant/Associate/Deputy), Controller of Examinations, Attestation Officer, Principal, Dean.   The same authority will need to seal the credentials in an envelope.  The same attesting stamp should be placed over the flap.   The university may issue the official credentials directly to UIC or to the student. As long as the seal is not broken, the credentials will be considered official.  Documents may be considered unofficial for any of the following reasons:  Attestation is not consistent.  If pages were stamped or sealed by different individuals, they are not considered official.   Attestation is not done by an acceptable authority .  Credentials were submitted in plain, unstamped or open envelopes.  Envelopes must be sealed at the time they are received by the Office of Admissions.  If envelopes were opened by a postal or other legal authority, retain and submit the documentation provided by them.   Attestation has been done by EducationUSA or other third party.                     Already applied?
