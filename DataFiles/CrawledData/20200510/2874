Consequently, the University of Illinois at Chicago seeks to maintain a campus environment that is free of the illegal use of alcohol and other drugs. To meet this goal, we promote and practice the Drug-Free Work Place Act of 1988 and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989 by annually producing and distributing this Alcohol and Other Drugs Policy. It summarizes some of the state and federal laws used to regulate alcohol and other drugs and the potential health risks associated with their use. The University’s standards of conduct, related policies, and established disciplinary actions for student conduct violations are outlined in this document as well as UIC campus and community resources for substance abuse issues.         2019-2020 UIC Alcohol and Other Drug Policy          Policies    Back to main content           Alcohol and Other Drug    Smoke Free Campus Policy and Fine Payment     Smoke/Tobacco-Free at UIC      Student Disciplinary Policy    Cannabis Policy                  UIC Logo        Wellness Center          Contact   Suite 238 750 S Halsted Street  Chicago, IL 60607  Phone: (312) 413-2120  wellnesscenter@uic.edu        Social Media Accounts    Facebook    Twitter    Instagram    YouTube             UIC.edu links   UIC.edu  Academic Calendar  Athletics  Campus Directory  Disability Resources  Emergency Information  Event Calendar  Job Openings  Library  Maps  UIC Safe Mobile App  UIC Today  UI Health  Veterans Affairs        Powered by Red 2.38.0  © 2020 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois |  Privacy Statement    Campuses   University of Illinois System  Urbana-Champaign  Springfield      Cookie Settings
