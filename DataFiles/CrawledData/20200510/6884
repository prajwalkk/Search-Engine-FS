Its purpose is to ensure faculty, staff and students have essential information to make informed and safe decisions about International Travel.  Today’s world is increasingly unpredictable, with local conditions that can rapidly change. Total safety cannot be guaranteed abroad just as it cannot be in the United States. The Study Abroad Office is committed to take the necessary steps to maximize student safety through working with our study abroad partners both here and abroad, scheduled student advising and orientation sessions, and materials distribution. The top eight things every student should do before going abroad are:    Research the country you are going to and find out as much as possible about its contemporary life. There are many sources for this information, but a good place to start is:     (a)   the U.S. Department of State     (b)   local newspapers – look for links under the World News tab on the SAO homepage, and     (c)   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention     (d)  Contact a Study Abroad Alum and talk to them about their experience. Ask an SAO advisor for names and contact information. Many of our program affiliates also have alumni contacts with students from all over the U.S. who may have gone on the program you’re thinking about.      Visit your doctor and/or a travel clinic and discuss your medical history and travel plans. An on-campus option is the UIC School of Public Health Travel Clinic .  Register with the U.S. Embassy  or Consulate in your program country through the State Department Smart Traveler Enrollment Program .  Find out where your home country’s closest embassy/consulate is located.   U.S. citizens: U.S. State Department  Non-U.S. citizens: please check with your nationality’s foreign affairs ministry or State Department-equivalent    Become familiar with U.S. State Department Services for U.S. citizens .   Know where to look for U.S. State Department announcements.    Embassy Notices are announcements from a U.S. embassy or consulate in a specific country. These announcements update citizens about a possible event that may cause disruptions in parts of the country and advises citizens on maintaining their safety. You will receive Embassy Notices after you sign up with STEP .     The Worldwide Caution  is a general announcement from Washington, D.C. advising U.S. citizens about the general risk of international travel, especially from acts of terrorism.      Travel Advisories are announcements for events the U.S. State Department thinks travelers should know about when planning travel to a country. There are four levels of advisory.  The Study Abroad Office does not support travel to any country in Level 4 [Do not travel].  Travel to countries listed in Level 3 [Reconsider Travel] can be petitioned.  Contact the Executive Director of Study Abroad for more information.    Note: If a program ends prematurely as a result of a Travel Warning being issued, the Study Abroad Office will work with students, partners overseas, faculty and administrators on campus to minimize any loss of finances and academic credit. However, the University of Illinois cannot guarantee that the student will not experience some financial or academic loss.   Attend a pre-departure orientation . All students going abroad through the Study Abroad Office are required to attend a pre-departure orientation meeting in order to be registered as a continuing UIC student while abroad. At this session the SAO staff review all university policies regarding academics, behavior, and safety issues.  Theft, Trip Cancellation, and Other Insurance.  We recommend that you consider buying supplemental insurance coverage addressing trip interruption or cancellation and theft. These may be two different insurance policies. You can search for these policies through your personal travel agent or online. Sometimes the credit card with which you purchase airline tickets will provide some coverage.              © Copyright 2014-2020 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois      Footer Navigation                    Vice Provost for Global Engagement  Office of External Scholarships  Office of Financial Aid  University Registrar  Centers for Diversity  Disability Resources  Privacy Policy  Contact Us          Translate » co      Cookie Settings
