(DMRT) Office, College of Dentistry, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), performs theory and policy research supporting the role of the dental profession in first responder and health security capacities. The DMRT Office has three primary objectives: 1) identify pathways to continue advancing the role of dental professionals in supporting disaster and pandemic response efforts of local responder teams, 2) assist in developing the associated policy changes needed to facilitate this involvement, and 3) research emerging dental anthropologic, forensic, and biometric standards and technologies that have the potential for use in first responder and health security activities.  Dental professionals serve in civilian and military first responder capacities during natural disasters, man-made (anthropogenic) disasters, and pandemic events, assisting various investigative and law enforcement agencies when processing missing people and identifying anthropological remains. Furthermore, dental professionals are able to utilize their unique diagnostic skill sets during forensic dental, oral, and facial data gathering and analysis for first responder activities. As such, dentists are uniquely positioned at the forefront of emerging biometric and forensic standards and technologies for these purposes, and can play a critical role in first responder and health security efforts.  The DMRT Office assists various University of Illinois, Illinois State, and Federal agencies, facilitating dental research consistent with the Illinois Dental Practice Act ( 2006 Original Act ; 2015 Amendments ) and the 2013 Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA) . DMRT faculty work in collaboration with faculty from the UIC College of Pharmacy Forensic Science Program and the UIC School of Public Health Emergency Management and Continuity Planning Program , and with members of the UIC Police Department . Additionally, we collaborate with a number of local, state, and national organizations, including: the DuPage County Health Department , the Security Working Group of the Illinois Medical District (IMD) , the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) , the Illinois Terrorism Task Force (ITTF) , the Illinois State Dental Society (ISDS) , and the Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors (ASTDD) . DMRT also assists the McHenry County Coroner's Office in anthropologic and forensic dentistry cases.  DMRT is also working to ensure the digital generated dental, oral, and facial data packets produced by next generation technologies will maintain secure targeting, acquisition, transmission, and movement, without interference and/or modification. This work is carried out in support of the American Dental Association (ADA) Standards Committee , the American National Standards Institute/National Institute of Standards and Technologies (ANSI/NIST)-Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) Working Group , and the ANSI Accredited Standards Committee (ASC Z136) .      Education & Training    Recommended Competencies  Core Disaster Life Support TM (CDLS)  Core Disaster Life Support TM is an instructor-led course designed for all public health care personnel and social workers, clergy, and mental health personnel, administrators and planners. CDLS TM is intended to provide a basic uniform standard of competencies, skills and knowledge to health care and public health responders for WMD response.  In this course, you will learn to:  Define All-Hazards Terminology  Recognize potential public health emergencies (PHE) and their causes, risks and consequences  Define the D-I-S-A-S-T-E-R™ paradigm  List scene priorities of a mass casualty incident (MCI) response  Describe pre-hospital and hospital medical components of a disaster incident response  Describe personal protective equipment (PPE) and decontamination  Describe the role of your local public health system in PHE's  Describe planning initiatives in Illinois and locally  Basic Disaster Life Support TM (BDLS)  Basic Disaster Life Support TM addresses the need to standardize emergency response and treatment for mass disasters, terrorism and other public health emergencies. BDLS TM is intended to provide an intermediate, uniform standard of competencies, skills and knowledge to front line health care and public health responders for WMD response. It focuses equally on the clinical and public health aspects of disaster. This course is geared to the needs of physicians, physician assistants, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, allied health professionals, public health professionals and veterinarians.  Skills Gained:  All Hazards Course Overview, a review of the D.I.S.A.S.T.E.R. Paradigm  Natural and Accidental Man-made Disasters  Traumatic and Explosive Events  Nuclear and Radiological Events  Biological Events  Chemical Events  Casualty Decontamination  Inoculation Training  Critical Incident Stress - Psychological Impact of Disasters  The Public Health System including media and communications utilization, regulatory and legal issues of event management, community and hospital disaster planning and community, state and federal disaster resources  Advanced Disaster Life Support TM (ADLS)  Advanced Disaster Life Support TM is an advanced practicum of the principles introduced in Basic Disaster Life Support™ (BDLS™) designed for persons on specialized response teams. ADLS TM is intended to provide an advanced, uniform standard of competencies, skills and knowledge to front line health care and public health responders for WMD response. Successful completion of the BDLS TM course is a prerequisite. This is a two-day course consisting of eight hours of didactic training and eight hours of hands-on training on an Emergency Care Simulator.  Day 1  ADLS TM includes lectures on the following:  MASS Triage™ in detail  Community and hospital disaster planning  Media and communications during disasters  Mass fatality management  In addition, small group interactive sessions allow students to work through a series of difficult questions of disaster management in a table top format  Day 2  Four skills stations reinforce the previous day's learning. These skills stations include the following:  MASS Triage™- This challenging station allows the students to practice the concepts of the disaster paradigm with an emphasis on patient triage. Simulated disaster victims must be triaged and treated correctly while attempting to manage a chaotic scene and request appropriate resources.  PPE and Decontamination - This station teaches important concepts about the use of Personal Protective Equipment and decontamination technique. Students are given the opportunity to wear PPE and participate in a simulated decontamination while attempting to render medical care.  Disaster Skills - This station teaches important information about vital skills necessary for medical disaster management. Students are taught vital information on the Strategic National Stockpile and proper Mark-I kit use. Students are also allowed to practice smallpox immunization.  Emergency Care Simulator - Recognition of victims of a chemical and biological disaster is paramount. This station is designed to reinforce the detection and proper treatment of conditions that may occur during disasters that we do not normally treat. Treatment of chemical, biological, and traumatic patients is covered. The use of these high fidelity simulators allows the student to see, hear and feel information that would normally be provided by an instructor. It allows for a more realistic experience than normal manikins would allow.  BDLS TM -certified individuals are eligible to take the ADLS TM course. The instructor-led presentation of ADLS TM is a sixteen credit-hour course; eight hours of classroom lectures and eight hours of hands-on practicum exercises. To maintain these credentials, renewal training is required every three years. Meets the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Code of Federal Regulations 1910.120 requirement for Hazardous Materials Awareness.
