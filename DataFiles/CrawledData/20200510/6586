What may seem like an insignificant concern to you lets us see a much richer picture of what may be happening for a student. Every piece of information matters and is helpful in providing a greater level of support for the students involved.  Early intervention  We believe in the principles of early intervention and proactive engagement and as such, we prefer to intervene at the earliest and lowest level possible. Earlier interventions preserve a wider range of options for students. Late interventions may result in a more significant impact on a student’s experience and progress towards degree.  Assistance for you  It is helpful to know you are not alone in managing a difficult situation. When you make a referral, we are always available to talk through the situation with you and help you determine the best way to proceed. You do not have to manage these situations by yourself.  It is your responsibility  UIC is a community and we all have a responsibility to care for each other. We all want our students to be healthy and successful. Referring students is one way you can help support the health and success of all UIC students, and make sure nobody slips through the cracks       Reporting an Incident   Community members, students, faculty, staff, and visitors are encouraged to report all crimes and public safety-related incidents to University of Illinois at Chicago Police Department (UICPD)  Call any of the following authorities, 24 hours a day:   Dial 911  Report emergencies or non-emergency criminal violations. 911 from a public phone or cell phone.
