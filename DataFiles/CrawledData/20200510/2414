As a result, all public-facing services will be down on October 15, 2016 . Major services include: ACM/LUG-hosted web services SSH to our public hostnames IRC Git VPN Internal internet connectivity should still be available, so no interruptions of the LAN party should take place.  We apologize for the inconvenience. If you have any questions, comments, and/or concerns, please feel free to contact the sigsysadmin mailing list.

The issue was first reported on September 17, 2016. As a result, workstations and servers will lock up and cause massive lag times between user input and expected output.  We are still currently evaluation solutions and are working towards a fix.  If you are using a workstation, we suggest to try to use the acmguest account for now, while we work through this issue. The acmguest account is not reliant on accessing personal files, so lag times shouldn't be an issue.  We apologize for the inconvenience. If you have any questions, comments, and/or concerns, please feel free to contact the sigsysadmin mailing list.  Update (September 28, 2016): Sysadmins may have found the issue.  It appears to be a switch malfunction.  All systems seem to be nominal at this point. We will continue to monitor the situation and report on any additional issues that may have occurred.

We are currently evaluating solutions, which caused some unplanned downtime today (September 18, 2016).  We apologize for the inconvenience.  If you have any questions, comments, and/or concerns, please feel free to contact the sigsysadmin mailing list.

During this period the website, secure shell access, ACM email, and file access may not be available. We do not expect these services to be down to the entire duration of the downtime period and will be sending out additional mail notices before any services are actually taken offline the day of.  For those who will be in the office a little early on the 19th, access to the internet via the ACM LAN network is NOT one of the services that will be offline during this time.  :D  Please direct any questions to the SIG mailing list: sigsysadmin@acm.cs.uic.edu  -Walter   Read more about NOTICE: Server downtime planned between 12PM and 3PM Saturday March 19th Log in to post comments        Server Room Electrical Issues - 03/08/2016 [Closed]     Submitted by clee231 on Tue, 03/08/2016 - 09:56     Sysadmins are currently monitoring the server room due to an early morning electrical issue causing an electrical smell.  We do not know any further information at this time.

Current known issues: Workstations cannot authenticate acm.cs.uic.edu cannot authenticate AD users If you see something broken, please report it to the systems mailing list: sigsysadmin@acm.cs.uic.edu  Thanks you for your patience, Chase Lee  Update #1 - This issue was caused by a malfunction in the cooling unit.  Engineers have been dispatched to remedy the issue.  Some servers automatically shutoff due to ambient heat. Update #2 - Cooling unit is back up. Servers have been restarted.  Sysadmins will continue to monitor the situation for the rest of the day.

There are a couple exceptions: ACM Mumble is currently down due to issues with it connecting to backend authentication brink.cs.uic.edu is currently inaccessible as the host virtual machine did not start up correctly acm.eecs.uic.edu is currently inaccessible as the VM hosting the beta for an updated website also failed to startup correctly That said, there are things we may have missed while we put out the big fires. So, if you see something broken, please report it to the systems mailing list sigsysadmin@acm.cs.uic.edu  Thanks for the Patience, Walter  Read more about Server Maintenance Concluded Log in to post comments        Server Maintenance Notice, Downtime between 5:30PM and 6:30PM today     Submitted by walter on Tue, 02/23/2016 - 11:12     The Sysadmin group will be finalizing some software updates during our meeting today between 5:30PM and 6:30PM. During this time various services hosted by the UIC ACM will go down as we begin our work. We will send follow up mail if difficulties are encountered that might extend downtime and when services have been restored. -Walter  Read more about Server Maintenance Notice, Downtime between 5:30PM and 6:30PM today Log in to post comments      Pagination     First page  « First      Previous page  ‹ Previous      Page 1     Page 2     Page 3     Page 4     Current page 5     Page 6     Page 7     Page 8     Page 9   …    Next page  Next ›      Last page  Last »      Subscribe to                Search         ACM Tools    Calendar    Mailing List Signup    UIC Mega Pathfinder    UIC Linux Guides    ACM Wiki    ACM IRC    ACM Mail    ACM Git Project Hosting    Public Git Projects      Committees    Program Committee    Publicity Committee    Membership Committee    Ways and Means Committee    Flourish!
