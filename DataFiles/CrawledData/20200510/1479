Frequently Asked Questions     How can I see which classes transferred over to UIC? Your options to view and discuss how your coursework transfer varies, depending on how far along you are in the process. Here is an idea of what you can expect.  UIC's Transfer Assistance Center staff members will notify you by email when your UIC DARS (Degree Audit Report System) audit is available. This will occur before the Intent to Enroll deadline for your term.  After you have received this notification, you are welcome to make an appointment with the Transfer Assistance Center to discuss your audit.   During Transfer Orientation, your UIC academic advisor will review your DARS audit and provide you with advice and recommendations regarding the registration and selection of UIC courses for your first semester at UIC. This is also an opportunity to discuss any discrepancies or to provide additional documentation for review.    Why is the cost of attendance on my financial aid award letter different than tuition and fees? The cost of attendance is a term used by the federal government to capture all costs associated with attending a university. The amount is a total of both billable fees (costs that are charged by the university, like tuition and fees), and costs that a student is expected to incur like transportation, living expenses, books and others. It is used primarily for the calculation of your financial aid.    How do I receive an award letter? You should add UIC to your list of schools on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). After you are admitted, the Office of Financial Aid will receive a student’s Student Aid Report (SAR) and begin packaging an award letter.  Once it is processed, your award letter will be available in the my.uic.edu portal.    Can I apply to the Honors College? If you did not apply to the Honors College through the Common Application, there may still be an opportunity to apply prior to the start of the semester. Transfer students admitted for the spring semester can apply through the Honors College website until December 1. Transfer students admitted for the fall semester can apply online through July 1. The strongest transfer candidates to the Honors College typically have completed 24 semester hours and have earned at least a 3.4 GPA. Candidates should also plan to be enrolled at UIC for at least three semesters.  Current UIC students may also be considered for Honors College under the same guidelines.    I didn't receive my admission packet in the mail. Can you help? No need to worry! All the necessary information to begin at UIC is available on this website. Additionally:  A copy of your admission letter is available in the my.uic.edu portal.    I forgot to apply to the Honors College on my application, can I still apply?
