Upon leaving UIC, a grace period is in effect for all services accessed with a UIC NetID and common password. At the end of the grace period access to services (including email accounts and email forwarding) is terminated. We recommend that students, faculty and staff leaving UIC download or migrate their email, calendars and documents prior to the end of the grace period.  Requirements  A valid UIC NetID and common password are required to authenticate to GSuite@UIC. You must create your GSuite@UIC account before you can use GSuite@UIC. Creation of a GSuite@UIC account requires accepting the GSuite@UIC Terms of Use.  Before you can access GSuite@UIC features from a desktop or mobile email or calendar application, you must change your common password in order to propagate it to Google.
