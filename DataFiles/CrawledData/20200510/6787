We encourage you to have your course approved by an advisor at your home institution before you register for it at UIC. You will want to provide your home college advisor with the UIC course description for approval. If your advisor requests a syllabus, contact the Summer Session Office and we can assist you.  Which Courses Transfer?  Many students use www.transferology.com to help them determine what courses will transfer back to their home school. However, we highly encourage you to speak with an advisor before making a final decision because certain courses may be transferable for some majors but not others. Only an advisor on your home campus can verify which courses will transfer correctly. Also, we suggest speaking with your advisor on how summer courses at UIC will affect your GPA as well as your progress towards your degree.  How to Transfer Courses at the End of Summer Session  UIUC/UIS students must request a UIC transcript at the end of the summer in order for their grades to be transferred back to their home campus. Grades do not transfer automatically. Check out the Grades and Transcripts page for detailed instructions on requesting a transcript.         Have a question?
