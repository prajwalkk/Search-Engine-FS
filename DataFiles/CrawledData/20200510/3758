Our goal is to train students to become creative and productive psychologists who can make significant contributions to their areas of expertise. To facilitate this goal we provide structured training, coupled with the flexibility needed for students to develop a program of study that best suits their unique interests and goals. At UIC, students work within a mentorship model, thereby allowing them to gain first-hand research experience under the supervision of one or more faculty members. Students are expected to be actively involved in either faculty-sponsored or independently supervised research continuously throughout their training.  The University of Illinois at Chicago is the largest institution of higher learning in the Chicago area, and is located just west of the famous downtown Chicago Loop. The campus includes over 90 buildings on over 200 acres, and has a student body of more than 24,000 students. Graduate housing is available on campus, and safe and affordable housing is also available in nearby Chicago neighborhoods and suburbs. The Chicago area is home to a number of universities, such as Northwestern and the University of Chicago, as well as a variety of psychological conventions, including the annual meeting of SPOC (Social Psychologists of Chicago) and the annual Midwestern Psychological Association convention.  It is our intention and practice to provide four years of financial support to all our graduate students who remain in good academic standing, pending continued availability of funds. Available stipends include University of Illinois fellowships, research assistantships, and teaching assistantships, all of which include tuition waivers.
