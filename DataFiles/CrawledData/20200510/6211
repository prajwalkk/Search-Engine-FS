Learn more about the Department of Restorative Dentistry​        PASS Application     Gainful Employment Disclosure              Program Description  The Advanced Prosthodontics Clinic houses the UIC ProCare Dental Group Implant and Innovations Center , where students learn the surgical and prosthetic aspects of therapy for implant patients. Limited class size provides an opportunity for students to individualize programs to meet their particular career goals. In addition to the didactic and clinical focus, postdoctoral students pursue study in basic science or clinical research and participate in teaching predoctoral dental students. The Department of Restorative Dentistry believes that this program will prepare specialists of high leadership potential by integrating sound clinical principles with knowledge and skills in a research discipline. Program length is a minimum of three years to allow completion of the clinical, didactic, and research components. Faculty range from prosthodontists in full-time clinical practice to scholars engaged solely in research.  The UIC Advanced Prosthodontics Program is progressive and stands out as a leader in providing comprehensive prosthodontics therapy. New clinical facilities are available for patient care. A new conference facility is available for prosthodontics and interdisciplinary seminars. Implant surgical care provided by prosthodontics students is included as a daily component of the integrated, comprehensive prosthodontics treatment philosophy that is based on innovation and advanced technology. Students have hands-on access to 3shape, DentalWings, and NobelBiocare scanners in the Advanced Prosthodontics laboratory for planning and providing patient care using multiple implant systems in the digital work-flow environment. Prosthetic milling is completed either on-site or by an outside laboratory.  The new prosthodontic clinics and laboratories contain state-of-the-art equipment for patient care and research. The urban setting of the University of Illinois at Chicago provides a large and diverse patient population, as well as an extensive offering of meetings and conferences for local, national, and international organizations. Students will be prepared for and encouraged to take the American Board of Prosthodontics Certifying Examination. Following successful completion of the program, opportunities exist for further study in basic science or clinical research. This is an incredibly progressive program with many opportunities. The goal is to produce clinical scholars.  Specific goals of the program include acquisition of in-depth knowledge and clinical experience in fixed prosthodontics, removable partial denture prosthodontics, complete denture prosthodontics, implant prosthodontics, maxillofacial prosthetics, and occlusion.  Program Flexibility  Within the parameters of expected didactic and clinical experiences, flexibility in the program exists to allow students to pursue specific interests and career goals. For example, when clinical progress forms suggest students will complete the expected experiences in a timely manner, students could focus to a greater degree on implant surgical experience, implant restoration, fixed prosthodontic esthetics, maxillofacial prosthetics, or orofacial pain patient management.  Students may also elect to pursue the Master of Science Degree in Oral Sciences. Didactic curriculum for the Advanced Prosthodontics Program that meet accreditation standards are aligned with the Master of Science curriculum.  Specific extramural experiences in the program include opportunity to attend a variety of meetings that broaden their learning experiences. The Department of Restorative Dentistry has supported student travel to the American College of Prosthodontists meeting for many years. Students have regularly attended the American Academy of Fixed Prosthodontics Annual Meeting, and have had further opportunities based upon individual interest to attend AAMOS and GNYAP meetings.  In summary, rotations, electives and extramural activities enrich the student learning and further contribute to their ability to meet program goals and objectives that enhance the graduate's preparedness and ability to challenge the American Board of Prosthodontics Certifying Examination.  Clinical Experiences  Student experiences as a whole provide a well-rounded Advanced Prosthodontics learning experience. This occurs though experiences totally within the College of Dentistry facility. Didactic experiences are generally within the College of Dentistry. Clinical learning experiences are within the Advanced Prosthodontics Clinic. Interdisciplinary communication for patient therapy occurs within the Advanced Prosthodontics clinic and other specialties throughout the College facility. Surgical observation occurs within the IIC and other surgical specialty clinics in the College. This provides the fundamental prosthodontics experiences based upon interdisciplinary therapy that are necessary to gain proficiency or competency.  Students rotate through the Oral Medicine and Orofacial Pain Clinic housed in the adjacent Periodontics area for their Temporomandibular Disorder clinical experience. They also rotate through the UIC College of Medicine Craniofacial Center for their maxillofacial experience. Each of these provides an excellent patient contact experience that allows the student develop the requisite knowledge and skills. Finally, students participate in teaching at the preclinical and clinical levels in fixed prosthodontics, removable prosthodontic and/or implant prosthodontics for predoctoral students on an ongoing basis. These experiences provide students an opportunity to develop communication skills critical for teaching and interdisciplinary communication in practice.  Maxillofacial Prosthetics Clinical Experience Treatment of patients who require maxillofacial prosthetic therapy. Students gain experience in diagnosis and treatment planning, surgery observation and prosthodontic treatment of patients with acquired or congenital defects. Oral Medicine and Orofacial Pain Clinical Rotations A clinical rotation that gives the student experience in diagnosis, treatment planning and management of a variety of temporomandibular disorder patients. Predoctoral Teaching in Prosthodontics Predoctoral teaching experience is obtained in preclinical and clinical courses related to fixed prosthodontics, removable prosthodontics and occlusion.  Facility  The Advanced Education Program in Prosthodontics has its own clinic, laboratory, study, and research facilities immediately adjacent to each other. The clinics and laboratories are equipped with state-of-the-art equipment for patient care and research. CT-scan facilities for implant patient diagnosis and treatment planning are available in the clinic, and the formatted scans are analyzed on-site using digital technology such as SimPlant, Facilitate, or NobelGuide software. The clinic houses the UIC Implant and Innovations Center , where all predoctoral and postdoctoral students diagnose, plan treatment, and provide therapy. Therapy occurs in this clinic with Advanced Prosthodontics attending faculty supervising comprehensive prosthodontic therapy including implant surgical placement.  Learning for the Digital Workflow  Students have abundant opportunities to provide the variety of digitally generated care from more-straightforward single crown therapies with milled lithium disilicate to the most complex full arch plans on implants or natural teeth. From diagnosis and treatment planning through definitive prosthesis milling, the Advanced Prosthodontics Program seeks support from its on-site Digital Design and Production Laboratory as well as off-site digital laboratories to provide state of the art prosthodontic care. Simplant and CoDiagnostiX are used for planning implant placement and guided surgery, and those plans can be transitioned to immediate implant restorations generated through digital design. The new Digital Center of Excellence provides an incredible environment for exposure to digital impressions, design and milling. Intraoral scanning is common for fabrication of provisional and definitive prosthetics. Clinic activity is supported by the department’s Digital Design and Production Lab. The 3shape and DentalWings laboratory scanners allow the production of esthetic restorations on site, as well as the off site fabrication of implant abutments and bars. Workflow between in-house and out-sourced laboratories is facilitated and coordinated by a full-time digital design technician, who ensures smooth information  transfer among scanning and milling platforms. These opportunities with faculty and staff support provide the necessary experiences for competence in the aspects of digital dentistry that support prosthodontic care.
