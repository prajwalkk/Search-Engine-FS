new discoveries       Research in the Department of Oral Biology encompasses all aspects of oral biology: cell and molecular biology of tissues of the oral cavity, signal transduction, biomineralization, genomics, tissue engineering of oral structures, applied clinical research, AIDS research, oral microbiology and cariology, functional anatomy, and evolutionary biology. The Department of Oral Biology laboratories provide an exciting environment for new discoveries in many areas of oral biology. Annual departmental funding approaches $2 Million per year. Funding sources include the National Institutes of Health (more than 50% from the National Institute for Dental and Craniofacial Research) and the National Science Foundation.        Research Training       Our principal duty is to teach many of the basic sciences to UIC's dental students. We are also teaching advanced oral sciences to graduate students. The Department is responsible for dental undergraduate courses Gross Anatomy (including Head and Neck Anatomy), Neuroanatomy, General Histology, Oral Histology, and Biology of the Human Dentition. Graduate classes encompass Advanced Oral Histology and other classes of the Masters' program. We are also contributing to non-departmental Graduate Courses such as the Seminars in Oral Sciences and Research Methodology. Our first-rate teaching level has been rewarded by numerous "Golden Apple" teaching awards to our faculty       Research Centers & Labs       The Department of Oral Biology laboratories provide an exciting environment for new discoveries in many areas of oral biology. Annual departmental funding approaches $2 Million per year. Funding sources include the National Institutes of Health (more than 50% from the National Institute for Dental and Craniofacial Research) and the National Science Foundation.  The Brodie Laboratory is a joint venture with the Department of Orthodontics ( Brodie Laboratory for Craniofacial Genetics ) and works on questions related to craniofacial genetics, genomics, and proteomics as they pertain to enamel and periodontal biomimetics and evolution.  Anne George ’s lab focuses on the molecular biology, biomimetics, and biochemistry of tooth dentin and dentin-related proteins. A particular interest are mechanisms of biomineralization.  Mineralized tissues occur widely in nature. In vertebrates bone, teeth and cementum are the principal mineralized tissues. The shapes of these tissues are defined by their organic components. In bone, dentin and cementum the organic matrix is comprised principally of collagen fibers and noncollagenous proteins. The fibrous arrays of collagen provide strength, while the rigidity and high compressive strength are derived from the apatite crystals of the mineralized phase, deposited within the collagen fibers. The noncollagenous (NCPs) proteins of bone and dentin, even though present in small quantities relative to collagen, are of extreme functional importance in the mineralization process. Please explore this review of Dr. Anne George's research for more information.  ​ Xianghong Luan ’s lab studies the molecular and genomic parameters that determine cell fate and commitment during the differentiation and bioregeneration of dental tissues. Her lab is part of the Brodie Laboratory for Craniofacial Genetics.  Lin Tao ’s lab research stretches from oral microbiology and cariology to AIDS research and AIDS prophylaxis.  More on the Department of Oral Biology Research Areas  UIC is a Leader in Research  The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is Chicago’s largest university and is one of the nation’s top federally funded public research universities. UIC is one of only seven Academic Health Centers in the country with a full complement of Health Sciences Colleges on a single campus (including medicine, pharmacy, dentistry, public health, nursing, allied health, and social work). Student and faculty investigators in UIC’s seven health sciences colleges work in an interdisciplinary research environment, with access to advanced research facilities, support for research design and data analysis, and a diverse patient population through the University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System . Learn more about Research at UIC .  More about UIC College of Dentistry Research  History  The University of Illinois at Chicago College of Dentistry prides itself in a rich leadership tradition in dental research and education. In the mid-20th century, the College boasted of brilliant teachers and educators such as Drs. E. Lloyd Du Brul, Harry Sicher, Frederick B. Noyes, Isaac Schour, Joseph-Peter Weinmann, and Allan G. Brodie Sr. Their textbooks, such as Dr. Sicher's and Dr. DuBrul's Oral Anatomy, Dr. Sicher's and Dr. Weinmann's Bone and Bones, and Dr. Noyes's Oral Histology and Embryology became classics and provided the basic oral biology education for generations of dentists. Today at the College, the Department of Oral Biology continues in that great research and education tradition. Among its teachers/researchers are several recognized as world leaders.

Craniofacial Pathology  Leading interdisciplinary investigations in the development and function of the craniofacial complex including processes that occur within cells and tissues to maintain health and control growth and development; understanding how alterations (genetic/environmental) result in disease (cancer) and study of microbiome/host interactions.    Regenerative Science  Moving beyond tissue replacement, using materials to enable our bodies to regenerate damaged and failing tissues. We are leading investigations into how materials interact with living tissues, and the building of tissue replacements for the growth of cells/tissues to replace lost tissues. The Center for Wound Healing and Tissue Regeneration (CWHTR) is a unique community of scientists and clinicians devoted to the study of injury, wound healing, and regeneration. The Laboratory of Applied Dental Biomaterials and Interfaces is a NIH funded center studying the properties of the tooth in order to develop reparative/regenerative biomaterials to replace lost tooth structure.    Clinical, Translational & Community  Leading transformative studies to improve oral health outcomes both in the clinic and the community. We have several centers and investigators focused on the study of the incidence and prevalence of disease; measuring outcomes of interventions; and safety and efficacy of drugs, devices, and treatments in individuals. We are also investigating how and why efforts to promote oral health through intervention are accepted by communities. The Oral Medicine and Pharmacognosy Research (OMPR) Laboratory focuses on medical anthropology and ethnopharmacology to study the non-destructive radiation in oral diagnostics and forensics. The Dental Medicine Responder Training (DMRT) is performing theory and policy research supporting dental professionals for emergency preparedness throughout the community.
