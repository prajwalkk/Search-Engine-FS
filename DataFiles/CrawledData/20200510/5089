UIC’s Office for Access and Equity and its campus partners are part of the third cohort, which includes 36 diverse institutions from across North America. The goal of the program is to build on what’s working, embrace what’s new, and navigate the changing tides of what’s next through the Culture of Respect’s system-based approach to ending campus sexual violence.
