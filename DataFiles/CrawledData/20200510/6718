If you have been the victim of a job or phishing scam, immediately contact the UIC Police.  Avoiding a Job Posting Scam: • Do not give your personal bank account, PayPal or credit card information when applying or when accepting a position. • Do not have funds deposited into any accounts. In most cases, arrangements for direct deposit should be made during your first day or first week of actual employment. • Do not transfer, wire or send money through a courier (i.e. FedEx). • Do not respond to suspicious or "too good to be true" unsolicited job emails.  Identifying a Potentially Fraudulent Job Posting: • You must provide your bank account or PayPal information. • The contact email contains a non-business email or personal email. • In some cases, a posting may appear to be from a reputable or known company but the email address does not match the domain. • Never forward payments - they want to access your bank account. • Most jobs never ask for an initial investment (Some networking marketing related jobs may ask you to pay a fee to obtain a sample product). Note that they are still asking you for money. • The posting includes spelling and grammatical errors. • A high salary is listed for minimal skills. • You are asked to provide a photo of yourself.
