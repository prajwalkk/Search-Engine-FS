There are no limits to what you can do, but neither are there any guarantees. Successful outcomes are achieved by those that are invested in their own future.          Professional Development and Recruiting     Professional Development    MBA 590  Leadership & Improv (a 2-credit elective) is not required… but it should be. It has nothing to do with your concentration and everything to do with your concentration at the same time. It is all about professional presence.  Professional presence is a combination of verbal and non-verbal abilities that are recognized as a poised, authentic communication style, particularly in spontaneous or impromptu interactions. This kind of style, however, is not superficial—it is critical to your productivity and effectiveness. Our Professional Development faculty will give you the tools and the encouragement to meet these challenges. Whether it is public speaking, navigating a cocktail party, networking, interviewing for a job or asking for a raise.  Our faculty have one foot in the world of Improv (each of them have trained and taught at Second City) and one foot in the business world. Using simulations and adapted theater techniques, this course is an experiential workshop that creates a safe laboratory for you to experiment with the elements of your own professional presence. Take this eight-week class early in your graduate career. You will not be sorry!      Top Companies    Our students land at a diverse variety of companies.
