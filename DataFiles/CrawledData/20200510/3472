The department houses 22 research laboratories that presently manage more than $24 million in collective grants , primarily from government and industry. New grants have been made in the past year by Arete Biosciences, Argonne National Laboratory, the Israeli Ministry of Defense the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, and USG.  Most MIE research is conducted in two campus buildings: the Engineering Research Facility, opened in 2001, and Science and Engineering Laboratories East. As of August 2019, department researchers also have full access to UIC’s new Engineering Innovation Building. This cutting-edge facility houses several flexible, open-use labs as well as a high-bay laboratory for large-scale projects and structural testing.
