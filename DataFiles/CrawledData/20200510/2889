It emphasizes ridding your mind of attention and distraction. Meditation may focus on breathing, a mantra, or a calming sound.  Open-monitoring meditation: Encourages broadened awareness of all aspects of your environment, train of thought, and sense of self. It may include becoming aware of thoughts, feelings, or impulses that you might normally try to suppress.   You‚Äôre not trying to turn off your thoughts or feelings. You‚Äôre learning to observe them without judgment. And eventually, you may start to better understand them as well.
