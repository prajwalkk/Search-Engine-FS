Preparing Students for Success in the Workplace   The Institute of Leadership Excellence and Development at UIC Business builds student success by providing all business students with an innovative professional development program designed to develop the key skills in demand by today’s employers. These skills go beyond traditional classroom academics and focus on the intangible soft skills that equate with future success in the workplace. Utilizing improvisational theatre techniques and experiential learning activities, UIC Business faculty lead students to practice teamwork, problem-solving, decision-making, and relationship-building skills. Experiential coursework, internships, community service, mentoring and advising form the unique components of the program.       Key Competencies for Successful Careers   The iLEAD Professional Development Program at UIC Business develops real-world competencies in four key areas: Communication, Personal Growth, Teamwork, and Professional Presence. UIC Business students who have developed these skills find that they interview with greater confidence and realize success more quickly in the workplace. They are often entrusted with greater responsibility earlier in their careers and promoted more quickly.      Communication    Verbal communication  Written communication  Presentations      Personal Growth    Learning  Self-awareness  Self-development  Giving/receiving feedback  Ethics      Teamwork    Collaboration  Value diversity  Plan, organize, prioritize  Manage conflict  Influence others      Professional Presence    Relationships  Initiative  Confidence  Motivation           Improvisational Theatre and Experiential Learning Activities      Using improvisational theatre techniques, UIC Business instructors engage students in a variety of experiential learning activities that train students to use their face, body, voice, and emotions to respond spontaneously to situations as they arise. Improvisation teaches poise, focus, and the ability to respond to the unexpected—critical management capabilities. Students practice elevator pitches, interviewing techniques and presentation skills, and learn how to work a room in networking events. Community service projects develop problem-solving and team-building skills while allowing students to strengthen their leadership abilities. Feedback reports, guest speaker events, and targeted workshops provide additional enrichment opportunities.       iLEAD Professional Development Program Curriculum   The iLEAD PDP curriculum is required of all UIC Business students beginning their first year on campus. Transfer students also have a course specifically designed just for them. The required curriculum is enriched with opportunities that include mock interview practice, seminars, feedback reports and case competitions.
