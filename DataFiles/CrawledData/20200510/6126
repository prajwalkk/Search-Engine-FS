It also affords the medical faculty the opportunity to test and perfect biomedical technology. Their goal is to continue to develop life-saving, non-invasive surgical procedures that can be used in operating rooms throughout the country. Laparoscopic Training Laboratory Robotic Surgical training Laboratory Laparoscopic Training Laboratory LAPROSCOPIC TRAINING LABORATORY The Surgical Education Laboratory was developed to provide medical professionals an opportunity to practice surgical techniques in a non-clinical setting. The goal of this facility is to improve the overall quality of patient care by lowering personnel training costs and developing surgeon competency prior to performing a procedure on a patient. General Surgery residents rotate to this facility on a regular basis where surgical and minimally invasive skills are taught. The surgical education lab utilizes the latest technologies in surgery. It is equipped with 5 state-of-the-art video towers for practice of endoscopic surgery. In addition, the facility also has available various simulation training models for practice of minimally invasive surgery.  Residents will have the opportunity to become familiar with state-of-the-art technologies in a laboratory setting. Robotic Surgical training Laboratory ROBOTIC SURGICAL TRAINING LABORATORY Our training lab is a state-of-the-art facility that includes a DaVinci robotic system and a robotic surgery simulator. This is the ideal setting to develop the first basic skills in robotic surgery, and also practice and develop skills in advanced applications of the robotic system.
