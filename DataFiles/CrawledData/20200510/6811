If you are checking for the first time, use your email address and the temporary PIN that you received in the “Summer Session application acknowledgement” email that was sent to you several hours after you applied.  If you have already logged in and are checking again, use your email address and the password you created when you first logged in.   If a decision hasn’t been made on your application yet and additional documents are required, you will see which ones we still need on your application status checklist. The checklist may indicate that you need to provide college transcripts, but this requirement is waived for Summer Session Only applicants.
