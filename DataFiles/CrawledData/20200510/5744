Joining the UIC Community  Before the first day on the job, employees can take several actions to ensure a smooth start to their career at UIC.   Register for a benefits information session prior to your start date. This half-day session provides detailed benefits information and necessary enrollment forms to help new employees select benefits that best fit their needs.  Before their start date, newly hired employees receive an email confirming their start date, work hours, work location, and supervisor’s name. This information will be sent by a UIC HR recruiter to employee’s personal email address.   You and UIC Orientation Program  Employees have much to become familiar with in any new work environment. The You and UIC orientation program is available to new employees from the start and providesinformation and resources to become familiar with UIC’s work environment more quickly. You and UIC guides employees to discover the campus and access valuable employee resources. Campus orientation works with existing department and unit onboarding activities, making it easier for managers to focus energy on helping new employees apply their talents and skills and quickly become high performers.
