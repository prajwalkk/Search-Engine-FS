Course List         Code  Title  Hours     Summary of Requirements  Required Prerequisite and Collateral Courses 26  Major Requirements 39-40  General Education and Electives to reach Minimum Total Hours 54-55  Total Hours 120   Note: Teacher education students must fulfill certain other requirements. Please see below and consult the Council on Teacher Education section of the catalog for more information.  General Education  See General Education and Writing-in-the-Discipline in the  College of Liberal Arts and Sciences section for information on meeting these requirements. Students should consult the course lists below and their advisors to determine which courses are counted toward the General Education and Writing-in-the-Discipline requirements.  Teaching of Math Endorsement  Students who intend to obtain an endorsement in the teaching of mathematics in addition to licensure in the teaching of physics should pay special attention to the footnotes throughout this section. Additionally, students should complete 39 hours for the physics major, the requirements for the Minor in Mathematics, and additional course work that is specific to the endorsement in mathematics as described below.  Required Prerequisite and Collateral Courses   Course List         Code  Title  Hours     Required Courses  MATH 180 Calculus I a,b 4  MATH 181 Calculus II a 4  MATH 210 Calculus III a 3  CHEM 112 See advisor 5  Select one of the following: 5  BIOS 100 See advisor  CHEM 114 See advisor  Select one of the following: 3  MATH 215 Introduction to Advanced Mathematics  MATH 220 Introduction to Differential Equations  Total Hours 24   a This course is approved for the Analyzing the Natural World General Education category. b MATH 180 fulfills the LAS Quantitative Reasoning requirement. c This course is required to obtain an endorsement in the teaching of mathematics.  Major Requirements a   Course List         Code  Title  Hours     Required Courses  PHYS 141 General Physics I (Mechanics) b 4  PHYS 142 General Physics II (Electricity and Magnetism) b 4  PHYS 215 Computational and Mathematical Methods for the Physical Sciences 4  PHYS 244 See advisor 3  PHYS 245 Introduction to Vibrations, Waves, and Thermal Physics 4  PHYS 481 Modern Experimental Physics I c,e 4  PHYS 499 Survey of Physics Problems d,e 1  Select four of the following with at least three in physics: 15-16  PHYS 401 Electromagnetism I  PHYS 411 Quantum Mechanics I  PHYS 425 Modern Optics  PHYS 441 Theoretical Mechanics  PHYS 450 Molecular Biophysics of the Cell  PHYS 461 Thermal and Statistical Physics  PHYS 482 Modern Experimental Physics II  MATH 310 Applied Linear Algebra  or MATH 320 Linear Algebra I  Total Hours 39-40   a Students must earn a grade of C or better in all physics major requirement course work to be eligible for an Illinois teaching license in secondary physics. b This course is approved for the Analyzing the Natural World General Education category. c PHYS 481 fulfills the Writing-in-the-Discipline requirement. d Students must earn a grade of C or better in PHYS 499 e Concurrent registration in PHYS 481 and PHYS 499 is required. f MATH 310 or MATH 320 is required to obtain an endorsement in the teaching of math.  Minor in Mathematics  A Minor in Mathematics requires MATH 180, MATH 181, and MATH 210 (already taken in the prerequisites for the Physics major) and 8 additional hours of MATH, MCS, or STAT electives at the 200-, 300-, or 400-level (with one in the MATH rubric with the exception of MATH 205).  To earn an endorsement in the teaching of math, students should complete the requirements for the Minor in Mathematics and the specific courses listed below.   Course List         Code  Title  Hours     Required Courses  a  Select one of the following: 3  STAT 381 Applied Statistical Methods I b  STAT 401 Introduction to Probability b  MTHT 411 Advanced Euclidean Geometry c 3  Select one of the following: 3  MTHT 435 Abstract Algebra d  MATH 330 Abstract Algebra I d  Total Hours 9   a Students must earn a grade of C or better to earn an endorsement in mathematics teaching. b Course has a prerequisite of a grade of C or better in MATH 210 c Course has a prerequisite of a grade of C or better in MATH 215 d Course has a prerequisite MATH 210 and MATH 215 .  Students who intend to apply for the Master of Education in Instructional Leadership degree in order to obtain licensure in secondary science: physics with a math endorsement must complete a Minor in Mathematics that includes courses required for state teacher licensure.  Additional Requirements for Teacher Education  In addition to the specified course work in the major field, teacher education students must fulfill certain professional education course requirements, which are mandated by the State of Illinois:   Course List         Code  Title  Hours     Required Courses  ED 200 Education Policy Foundations 3  ED 210 Principles of Learning and Instruction Across the Lifespan 3  SPED 410 Exceptional Learners 3  CI 414 Middle and High School Literacy 3  PHYS 469 The Learning and Teaching of Physics 4  ED 425 Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessment in the Urban Secondary Classroom 4  ED 470 Educational Practice with Seminar I 6  ED 471 Educational Practice with Seminar II 6    Grades in the above courses must average at least 3.00 with no grade lower than C. Overall, students must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.50/4.00. For detailed information, see the Program Guide for Teacher Education in Physics , which is available from the secondary education coordinator in the Department of Physics.  The teaching license is not automatically awarded upon successful completion of licensure and degree requirements. Before the license is issued, the candidate must file an application for the Illinois teaching license with the Council on Teacher Education. The candidate must also pass a series of examinations required by the Illinois State Board of Education. The Test of Academic Proficiency must be passed prior to applying for candidacy with the Council on Teacher Education. The Content Area Test (s) must be passed before the candidate is allowed to student teach. The Assessment of Professional Teaching must be passed prior to licensure. For information on application procedures, contact the Council on Teacher Education located in 3015 ETMSW. See the  Council on Teacher Education section of the catalog.
