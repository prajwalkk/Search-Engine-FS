Why is Academic Integrity important?  Academic integrity, a foundational element of all educational communities, is the value underpinning everything we do at UIC. This value is a crucial component of not just the learning and skill building you do as a student, but also of the relationships you build with your professors and peers. Research shows that when you engage in academic misconduct, you both reinforce a culture of cheating 1 on campus and diminish the value of your and your peers’ degree among hiring companies 2 . By focusing on your own growth and integrity, you set yourself up for success at UIC and beyond.       Questions     How should I respond to an Academic Misconduct allegation?         Answer   First, remember a notification of an Academic Misconduct allegation is only an allegation, and primarily serves as notice the professor believes there is an issue. It is also an opportunity to see the evidence the professor has shared with the Office of Community Standards.  Second, once you examine the evidence you should decide how you wish to proceed. We recommend responding honestly with your perspective, including facts pertinent to the case but not represented by the professor’s incident report. As you think through your narrative, consider what evidence, including witnesses, you may wish to provide. Understand that while outside context may be considered, the details of the alleged violation are the pieces most closely considered by those making a decision in the case.  Most students who have not previously been involved in an Academic Misconduct case receive an Academic Liaison letter, which is a mutual agreement opportunity that includes the professor’s recommendation for an outcome. In this situation, you must decide if you wish to accept responsibility for the alleged violation and accept the sanction, or alternatively reject responsibility and/or the proposed outcome. Should you choose to reject, the case will move onto consideration for the formal process.  Should you have questions about the process, please don’t hesitate to contact us at 312-996-4857.        What happens if I’m found responsible in an Academic Misconduct case?         Answer   First, read your decision letter closely and decide if you wish to appeal. Once the decision is finalized, be sure to complete any outcomes in a timely manner. You can read about possible sanctions in section V.C.1-6 of the Student Disciplinary Policy .  Second, many students wish to know who will have access to their disciplinary records. You can read more about how long your disciplinary record will be kept and who can access it here , but the short of it is the information is only shared with those deemed “need to know” within the university or those you, the student, authorize.        If I need academic help, what resources online and on-campus are available to me?         Answer   UIC offers a myriad of on campus resources beyond your instructors, including the Writing Center , the Academic Center for Excellence , and a number of other tutoring centers . Should you need quick online guidance regarding how to use sources in your papers, the Harvard Guide to Using Sources provides a great foundation to understand the why and how of incorporating sources into your work. For style guide assistance on APA, Chicago Style, and MLA, the Purdue OWL site is incredibly helpful.             footnote   1 Jordan, 2001.  2 Carpenter, Harding & Finelli, 2006; Harding et al., 2003a, 2003b, 2004a, 20004b; Harding, Finelli, & Carpenter, 2006; McCabe, Treviño, and Butterfield, 2001.
