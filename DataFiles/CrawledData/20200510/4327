Graduates assess the degree of health or illness of individuals, plan, implement, evaluate, and supervise nursing care. Graduates of this program have collegial and independent relationships with other members of the healthcare team.  The prerequisite course work listed below prepares the student to apply to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program in the UIC College of Nursing. Completion of the pre-nursing curriculum does not guarantee admission to the College of Nursing. All prerequisite course work must be completed with a grade of C or higher.
