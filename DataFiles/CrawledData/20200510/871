Students apply for and obtain most assistantships through their graduate programs. The Human Resources Job Board has listings for assistantships that are open to the general graduate student population (see listings towards bottom of the above link).  Comprehensive information about assistantships is found at the UIC 101 Graduate Assistants page.  That page includes a Graduate Assistantship HR Resource Guide.

Teaching assistantships (description)    Research assistantships (description)    Graduate (administrative) assistantships          Work schedule         Work Schedule   The weekly clock hours of service are based on a forty-hour work-week. Thus, a half-time (50% FTE) appointment requires twenty hours weekly; a 25% appointment requires ten hours weekly; etc. Federal law restricts international employee appointments to 50% FTE (twenty hours per week) during the academic term, regardless of the number of positions held, e.g., a 25% RA can also hold a 25% TA. International students can exceed twenty hours weekly during academic breaks. And, work authorization is impacted by the graduation date.          Stipend         money   Minimum stipend amounts are established through collective bargaining. Departments may offer higher than the minimum. See Salary for Graduate Assistantships (includes eligibility criteria for the appointment to be qualified for a waiver of tuition and certain fees) for the current year. Specifications for upcoming years may be viewed in the contract – see the link in the Teaching (TA) and Graduate (GA) Assistantship Labor Agreement section below. Even though Research Assistantship (RA) appointments are not under the contract, the minimum stipend applies to those positions as well.      Salary for Graduate Assistantships          Application for Graduate Appointment         Application for Graduate Appointment   Verify with the unit or academic program from which you are seeking an appointment if they require the Application for Graduate Appointment form.

See the tuition schedule for information on specific tuition rates. Graduate students who hold academic appointments as assistants for the spring semester and for whom tuition and service fees were waived in the spring are entitled to a waiver for the summer term immediately following if they do not hold a summer assistantship, provided they are registered for at least three hours during that summer term. Graduate students holding a summer assistantship must satisfy eligibility requirements for a waiver, as described in the previous paragraph, as well as the registration requirements specified below. Assistantship waivers cover the following charges:   Full tuition, but note:  does not cover tuition differential, if applicable  disciplines under Liberal Arts and Sciences that have a differential will have it waived (Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Physics, and Psychology)    Service fee  Health service fee  Academic facilities maintenance fund assessment (AFMFA)  Library and Information Technology Assessment (LITA)  A portion of CampusCare Health Insurance, if the student chooses to be covered by the plan.

Some programs may require registration for more than eight hours per term and/or summer registration. Although the Graduate College does not require summer registration to hold a summer assistantship, a minimum of three hours registration is required to receive a summer tuition and partial fee waiver.  Students receiving an assistantship must maintain a minimum registration through the end of the term in order to retain the waiver. A minimum of eight (8) hours in fall and spring is required to hold a waiver attached to a 50% FTE assistantship; however, nine (9) credit hours are required to be eligible for a CTA pass. Summer registration is optional for students with summer appointments, but a minimum three (3) hours in summer is required to receive the waiver. International students may have additional registration requirements. Generally:   assistantship appointments of 50% require 8 hours in Fall and Spring semesters;  international students may be required to register for a greater number of hours in the Fall and Spring semesters if their appointment is less than 50% FTE.   Summer registration is not required (see above). International students should confer with the Office of International Services for additional information.
