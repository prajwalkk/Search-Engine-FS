Get the Course Listing    Program Sequence  The DMD-MPH follows a curriculum that allows students to complete both degrees in five years. Joint degree students are admitted simultaneously, and complete their MPH coursework in the first year of the program, followed by DMD coursework in years 2-5.  Students must meet the eligibility requirements for both programs.  If, for any reason, a student opts not to matriculate into the MPH program during this timeframe, the student must complete the MPH separately upon completion of the DMD program. Similarly, if a student enrolls in the DMD program only and later decides to pursue a MPH, the student will be advised to contact the School of Public Health directly to pursue this as a secondary degree upon completion of the DMD program.  The program timeline may be adjusted in response to specific training needs of individual students.         Career Opportunities  The DMD-MPH program offers an exceptional opportunity for those interested in becoming oral health practitioners and leaders in public health. Students will gain knowledge in key areas at the intersection of oral sciences and public health, including community-based oral health program management, care systems evaluations, research and surveillance system design, policy setting and advocacy. These competencies will prepare graduates for roles in health systems, government agencies and private sector organizations that advance public health, develop and advocate oral health policy, and conduct epidemiological research investigations.
