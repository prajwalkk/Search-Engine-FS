Interested in master’s-level study in our department? Download our master’s program booklet here.  PhD applicants: Successful applicants for doctoral study should have a master of science degree in their field from an accredited institution and should have completed substantial coursework in the chosen field of study. The department does consider outstanding PhD applicants who have only a bachelor’s degree through a program called “direct admission.” Please see the direct admission section below for more information. PhD applicants should have a GPA of 3.5 or higher on a scale of 4.0, based on the last 60 semester hours of undergraduate coursework completed.  Master of Energy Engineering applicants: The MEE program has its own admissions requirements and process. We invite you to visit the Master of Energy Engineering website , which offers all the information you need.       Application Requirements for MS and PhD Students   Applicants must meet the requirements of the Graduate College and the requirements of the department. In general, applicants should be prepared with the following:   Admissions application  completed online  Transcripts of all previous undergraduate and graduate work  English competency test. Applicants whose native language is not English are required to take an English competency test. Minimum required scores are: iBT Internet-based TOEFL of 80, with subscores of Reading 19, Listening 17, Speaking 20, and Writing 21; New Paper-Based TOEFL (after August 2018) of 60, with subscores of Reading 19, Listening 17, Writing 21; Institutional Testing Paper-Based TOEFL (prior to August 2018) of 550; IELTS of 6.5, with all four subscores of at least 6.0; or PTE-Academic of 54, with subscores of Reading 51, Listening 47, Speaking 53, and Writing 56.  Tests Required (PhD applicants only): The GRE general test assists us in determining funding awards for doctoral students.  Application for Graduate Appointment form (PhD applicants only). This form is required for PhD applicants who want to be considered for fellowships, assistantships, tuition and fee waivers, and other forms of financial aid.  A personal statement and three letters of recommendation are required for the application.        Direct Admission for PhD Applicants   Most PhD applicants already have earned (or are about to complete) a master of science degree in mechanical engineering, industrial engineering, or a related field. However, exceptional applicants who seek to start the PhD with only an undergraduate degree may be considered for what is called “direct admission.” Students who are admitted to the PhD program with only a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, industrial engineering, or a related field must complete all 108 credit hours toward the PhD degree (compared with students entering with an MS degree, who can transfer in 32 earned credits from their master’s program).       Deadlines for MS and PhD Applications   Information about application deadlines is on the Graduate College’s admissions deadlines page .  Special note: To give prospective students additional time to prepare their applications, applications from U.S. students will be accepted until June 15, 2020 , for the MS and PhD in mechanical engineering or industrial engineering and for the master of energy engineering.
