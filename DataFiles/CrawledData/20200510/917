Located on the Illinois-Iowa border, with the Mississippi and Rock Rivers at our doorstep, the Quad Cities Campus offers a beautiful, small-town setting in which to earn a nationally ranked graduate degree. Due to a unique regional partnership, students who live in Iowa or Illinois pay the same in-state tuition so that nurses from either side of the river can choose UIC Nursing for their next degree. We also enjoy robust relationships with healthcare partners in both Illinois and Iowa, giving students a range of clinical experiences, never too far from home.
