Over 1500 women traveled to the Hague to demand peaceful resolutions and more just alternatives to war. What does women’s international peace organizing look like today?  Monica Trinidad , a queer, Latinx artist and organizer born and raised on the South Side of Chicago, is the co-founder of Brown and Proud Press (2012), For the People Artists Collective (2015) and the People’s Response Team (2016). Her artwork highlights campaigns and movements in Chicago from 2014 through 2019 that have largely been led by Black and Brown women and young girls. She ties local resistance to police brutality and state violence to the broader struggle against war and militarism in the U.S. and abroad.  Sarah-Ji , prison abolitionist and community organizer, exhibits photographs that document the extensive social justice organizing in Chicago from the past ten years. Focusing on Black women in Chicago, her work serves as a powerful visual record of the legacy of resistance and activism of those who are often erased or rendered invisible. Sarah-Ji and Trinidad’s work demonstrate that Chicago organizers, primarily led by women and queer communities of color, have been building powerful, internationalist perspectives in their grassroots organizing work for a long time.  This ongoing exhibition is free and open to the public.  Museum Hours: Tuesday to Friday & Sunday 9:00am – 5:00pm Closed Mondays and Saturdays  Public Tours: Public Tours are offered Tuesday to Friday & Sunday at 10:00am & 3:00pm.
