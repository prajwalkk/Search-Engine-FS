While connected to the VPN, the client software works with the operating system to determine when you are accessing an Internet location that the client should protect. When you are accessing such a location, the VPN client encrypts the data.  There are two group options when connecting to AnyConnect: General-Use and Library-Resources .  General-Use Allows you to connect to your UIC department resources, such as research data sets. You can still access most library resources through the library website, but you will have to authenticate with your NetID and password (the way it works when you are off-campus).  A few library resources can be accessed only on campus -- for those resources, you must use the Library-Resources group.  Library-Resources Gives you direct access to library electronic resources such as full-text articles from Google Scholar, JSTOR or PubMed, and on-campus only resources without logging in to each database.
