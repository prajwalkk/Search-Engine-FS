Hofman Director of Undergraduate Studies, Cecilia Gerber, gerber@uic.edu Student Services: Melodie Shaw, melodies@uic.edu    The fundamental goal of the science of physics is to develop a basic and comprehensive understanding and description of all forms of matter and energy. This goal is pursued through experimental and theoretical investigations, with experimental results pointing the way toward possible new theories and tentative theories suggesting new experiments. Physics occupies a middle ground between mathematics and engineering, using the techniques of the former and providing new ideas and materials (structures and properties) to the latter.  The Department of Physics offers the Bachelor of Science in Physics (Curriculum in Physics) and the Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts and Sciences with a Major in Physics.  The Physics major who continues on to a PhD or who combines a physics background with an advanced degree in engineering or another science, or with an MBA, will find many positions available in industry. The Physics major who obtains a PhD will qualify in many cases for a faculty position in engineering as well as physics.  In addition to the Physics majors, the department also offers a Minor in Physics. The minor in physics is an attractive option for students in the math, chemistry, biology, pre-health, and engineering programs.  Distinction  Departmental Distinction  Distinction in physics is awarded to students who achieve college honors and an overall minimum GPA of 3.50/4.00 in upper-division physics (400-level) and mathematics (300-level and above) courses.  Students who qualify for departmental distinction are recommended for high or highest distinction on the basis of grade point average and/or high performance in PHYS 391 or PHYS 392 , described as follows.  High Distinction  A minimum overall GPA of 3.70/4.00 in upper-division physics and mathematics courses or a minimum overall GPA of 3.50/4.00 in upper-division physics and mathematics courses and high performance in PHYS 391 or PHYS 392 , as judged by the instructor of the course.  Highest Distinction  A minimum overall GPA of 3.80/4.00 in upper-division physics and mathematics courses or a minimum overall GPA of 3.70/4.00 in upper-division physics and mathematics courses and high performance in PHYS 391 or PHYS 392 , as judged by the instructor of the course.
