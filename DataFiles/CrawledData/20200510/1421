It is advisable to write your UIN on every page of documentation you submit and also to print legibly within the appropriate sections of a form.  This ensures that documents can be promptly read and processed.  Please note, due to the COVID-19 crisis, financial aid is only able to accept uploaded documentation (see PDF Upload Guide for assistance) at this time.
