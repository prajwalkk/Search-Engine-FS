Whether for academic, financial, or other personal reasons, such actions are understood to be life-changing. Students considering such actions are strongly encouraged to seek the advice of the Office of the Dean of Students, their academic advisors and the Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships to understand the implications of the decision.  Students in the graduate and professional schools who decide to withdraw from their programs-of-study should meet with their college’s Dean’s office to review their plans.  Also, International students should report their decision to withdraw to the Office of International Affairs.       FAQs     If I withdraw, will I get money back?         If I withdraw, will I get money back?   There is a tuition refund schedule based on last date of attendance. A refund schedule can be found on the Registrar’s page .        What will my transcript say about my withdrawal?         What will my transcript say about my withdrawal?   When you withdraw, the Registrar’s Office processes the form.  Instead of a letter grade, you will receive a “W” in place of a grade.  The “W” is not weighted and does not factor into your GPA.        If I withdraw, what happens to my financial aid?         If I withdraw, what happens to my financial aid?   Depending on when you withdraw, and the source of your awards, your financial aid may have to be reduced or canceled for the term.  If your financial aid is canceled or reduced, you might owe money to the University.  Federal regulations require Financial Aid Services to apply a formula established by the U.S. Department of Education to determine the amount of federal financial aid a student has earned as of the date the student last attended classes.  The amount of federal financial aid returned to federal aid programs is determined by the amount of time the student spent in academic attendance, but has no relationship to the institutional charges incurred by the student.  After 60% of the semester has passed, the student has earned 100% of the federal financial aid awarded to them. For students receiving state financial aid, a state refund calculation will be completed. The state refund calculation takes into consideration the amount the student owes and the amount of federal aid the student may remain eligible for.  For more information, please contact Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships at 312-996-3126.        Can I withdraw from a course if I am involved in a pending Academic Misconduct violation?         Can I withdraw from a course if I am involved in a pending Academic Misconduct violation?   Students involved in an Academic Misconduct case should not withdraw from the course in which the violation is alleged. If a student withdraws from such a class during an allegation of Academic Misconduct, they should be aware that the University is likely to reenroll the student in the course should the student be found responsible.        If I want to withdraw from a course but retain some of my classes, what do I do?         If I want to withdraw from a course but retain some of my classes, what do I do?   If you need to withdraw from a course during the semester, you may add/drop the course on SPIRE , with no record, during the add/drop period.  After the add/drop period, and until the mid-semester date, you can drop a course with a “W.”  You can pick-up the form at the Registrar’s Office. You must have the instructor sign the form before completing the process.  After the mid-semester date, the only option is to petition your Academic Dean.  Requests are only granted for extenuating circumstances.             Warning   WARNING:  If you withdraw from a course and your total enrollment goes below 12 credits, it may affect your health insurance coverage, your on-campus housing for your next semester, or your financial aid award.  Please check with Financial Aid Services, Patient Services, and Residential Student Services.
