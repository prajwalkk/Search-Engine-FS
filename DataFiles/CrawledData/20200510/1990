Whether your interview is over the phone, through video conference, or in-person, there are many ways to prepare and do well in an interview. Below are some tips and resources to help you prepare for your upcoming interview before, during, and after.  Interview Tips & Sample Questions           Interview Room Unavailable Until Further Notice  NOTE: Interview room is unavailable until further notice due to ECC temporary closure in response to COVID-19.

ALL students who use the interview room must abide by our policies at the link below.   Policies         Interview Tips     Types of Interviews         Types of Interviews   Phone   Typically mostly behavioral interview questions (e.g. “Tell me about a time when…”).   Video (recorded)   Video interviews are starting to take the place of phone interviews.  Companies like video interviews because they can interview more candidates in less time. They can also forward the recorded interview to engineers or developers within their company who can watch the video and provide candidate feedback when they have the time.  HireVue is one very common video recording software that companies utilize.   Technical   Can be a coding interview (done on a computer or traditional white board).  Can be a case interview (candidate is provided with case examples to problem solve).  Can be a personality test (usually online and multiple choice).   In-Person   Usually done on-site at the company headquarters.  Can also be over a meal, or over coffee (common for start-ups).  Usually two or more interviewers will be present at an in-person meeting (expect a few people potentially).         Prepare for Your Interview         How to Prepare For Your Interview   Research the Company   Review company website, Google and search social media to learn about the current events, projects, or transitions within a company.  Follow the company on LinkedIn and like their content to show interest.  Search the company on Glassdoor, see if you can find previous interview questions that former candidates have been asked in interviews.   Practice   You can anticipate a decent number of questions you may receive at any interview. For example:  Tell me about yourself.  Why do you want to work here?  Why do you want this position?  Do you have any questions for us?    Outline answers to “Tell me about yourself,” “Why this job?” and “Why this company?” weaving in how you and the company align.  You can even outline answers on paper to help you practice.  For phone and/or video interviews, even have a copy of your outline present to help you when you get nervous (since they can’t see your outline!).  If the job description calls for detail-oriented work, and the company is looking for an engineer who knows AutoCAD, talk about those specific skills in your responses.  Do not assume every interviewer has your resume in front of them! Make sure to provide detailed responses with specific examples to interview questions.    Prepare to answer behavioral interview questions by using the STAR Method: Situation, Task, Action, and Result:  Situation: “what was the problem?”  Task: “what needed doing?”  Action: “what steps did you take?”  Result: “what was the outcome?”    Schedule a mock interview if you need more in-person practice.  Practice video interviews for free with your student account on InterviewStream .   Attire & Personal Hygiene   Engineering and Computer Science companies may have different definitions of professional dress.  Even if your day-to-day job may not require you to wear a suit, it is always recommended to wear a suit, or at least business casual attire to an in-person interview. Make sure you have appropriate attire available to wear the day of your interview.  Personal hygiene is very important, especially at an in-person interview. You want to arrive at your interview looking and smelling clean. Avoid strong-smelling cologne or perfume and do not smoke before an interview.  Practice giving a good, firm handshake.  Consider doing a “test drive” to your interview so you know exactly where to go the day-of and how long it will take you to get there.         Technical Interview Preparation         Tech Interview   Online Resources   Geeks for Geeks  HackerRank  Reddit List of Developer Questions  Glassdoor – you can occasionally find previous questions that candidates were asked at interviews  See additional online resources below.   Peers & Practicing   Consult with your network, friends, professors, etc. to learn some possible technical interview questions you might receive at your interview.  Practice, practice, practice. UIC has installed white boards all over campus in common areas, and in the CS Lounge. Practice by yourself, or find a class member who can help you practice.         Before Your Interview         What to do before    Check the news in the morning. There may be something going on that day within the company that you could use to break the ice.  Bring a pad-folio, with extra copies of your resume, a copy of the position description you applied to, and a list of questions to ask your interviewers.  Brush your teeth, or pop a breath mint right before your interview.  Arrive 10 minutes early.  Review the resume to give yourself a confidence boost. Remember that the company would not be interviewing you if they weren’t interested!  Greet the front desk workers. How you treat support staff is often noticed by interviewers.  Give everyone you encounter at the company a firm handshake.         During Your Interview         What to do during    Maintain good eye contact.  Be personable, enthusiastic and genuine. Employers can tell if you’re embellishing or not expressing interest.  Be sure to take notes during the conversation. Looking down, pausing and taking notes, are all acceptable behaviors during the interview.  Have 3-5 questions prepared including, “what are our next steps?”  If you are doing a phone and/or video interview, you can review your question “outline” which has some responses to questions that you have already outlined.  Thank everyone who interviewed you and get their business card or email address so you can send a thank you note later, or even a LinkedIn request.         After Your Interview         What to do after    Write everyone you met or spoke with at the interview a kind thank you note , incorporating notes you took from the interview.  If you forgot to take down emails or obtain business cards, do not worry. You can always send your thank you email to the person who organized your interview and ask them to kindly forward.    Look at a calendar and map out the exact date when they said you should hear back. If you don’t hear back from the employer by that day, check in with them the following business day.  Try connecting over LinkedIn to elicit a response if email doesn’t work.  Be patient. Often times the selection process can take a long time.         Practice Questions         Practice Questions    Tell me about yourself.  Why are you interested in this position?  Why are interested in working at this company?  Why should we hire you over the other applicants for this position?  Tell me about a recent group project you worked on.  What would you do if you were placed on a project without a lot of direction?  What is your greatest strength?  What is your greatest weakness?  How do you manage multiple projects/deadlines?  Tell me about a time you had to work on a project with a difficult team member. What happened?  Tell me about a time when you failed.  Do you have any questions for me?         Questions to Ask/Not Ask in an Interview         Questions   Questions to Ask:   What are your expectations of me in the summer internship?  What does a typical day look like in this role?  What are you expecting of me (things completed) by the end of the internship?  What is the work environment like? (physical, cubical, shared office, etc.)  What projects will I be working on specifically?  What will my training look like?  Tell me about the structure of the team.  Tell me about your managing style?  How do you define success?  Tell me about the most favorite intern you have worked with. What made them your favorite/or why they stood out to you?  Tell me about a time when you worked with an intern and they disappointed you. Can you describe the situation and what happened?  What are your pet peeves?  Tell me about the next steps/timeline for decision.   Questions Not to Ask:   Do not ask about your possible salary.  Do not ask about benefits, vacation/sick time, etc.  You may ask salary and benefits questions after you have received a job offer.    Do not ask about any required background checks.  You will find out about any required background screenings once you have received a job offer.
