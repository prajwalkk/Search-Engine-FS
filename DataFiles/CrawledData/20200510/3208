Please email idcenter@uic.edu for assistance determining if your issue is considered emergent.      The State Carding Office has recommended that all ID Centers adhere to these policies during the stay-at-home order:      Normal card operations are suspended until the University deems it is safe to return to normal operating hours;  New IDs will be issued on a case-by-case basis, if there is an emergency situation supporting the request;  Replacement IDs will be issued on a case-by-case basis if there is an emergency situation supporting the request;  Cards with expiration dates in March or April 2020 have had expiration dates extended thru the end of May, and could be extended longer if the stay-at-home order extends;   Lost IDs will be replaced if there was an emergency supporting the request.      The ID Center will work with each case-by-case request to identify if the request is emergent, and will recommend other options that may produce the same outcome (with regard to door access the use of a “Departmental Card”, or for Parking which has shifted some lots to not require a card for entry).      We are working with CTA to clarify and plan for the continuity of the UPASS program for the remainder of the semester, and subsequent periods.     Our Mission The mission of the ID Center is to support the university community with a standardized and convenient form of identification.
