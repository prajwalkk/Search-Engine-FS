The changes and new features in the portal are:   There is only one tab level, reducing the number of clicks to access various systems.  Single Sign On for both Enterprise Applications (Registration, Grades, etc.) or Bluestem/Shibboleth Applications (email, Blackboard, etc.)  The most commonly used features are now on the Welcome tab (landing page).  Mobile friendly.  You can add any portlet to your "My Favorites"  There are fewer tabs: Welcome has the most commonly used functions; Student has all of the student functions; Student Services lists services on one tab; Help lists the support contacts.
