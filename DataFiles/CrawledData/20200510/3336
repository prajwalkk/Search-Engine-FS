About us — UIC HCI    Located in the heart of Chicago city, we are the newly formed Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago. At UIC, Chicago’s only public research university, we design computer technologies that create transforming human experiences and deliver positively impactful societal change.    To support individual and social activities and improve everyday life, we design, build, and evaluate ubiquitous computing technologies. Our design deeply draws from our research on how people work, play, and communicate in day-to-day life.
