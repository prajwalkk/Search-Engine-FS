For more information for undergraduate students , please visit the following link . For more information for graduate students , please visit this link .  Helpful Hints: Staying Motivated and Focused while Online Learning   Set up a designated study area that is not on a couch, bed, or other place where you are liable to fall asleep. Having a table/desk and chair would be the most ideal setup.  Make sure the space is well lit and in a low-traffic area of the household.  Turn off TVs, smartphones/social media, music, and any other electronics that could be distracting. If at all possible, turn off the internet browser to avoid web wandering.  Designate specific study hours at times of the day when you know you function at your best and schedule in a certain number of hours per day to work on your schoolwork.  Set a timer for a designated amount of study time (an hour, two hours, at a time etc.) then take a break or go for a walk outside once the time is up. Incorporating physical activity intermittently, even minimally, throughout the day will help with focusing issues.  Make a short checklist of all that is needed to accomplish for the day and cross out items as they are completed.  Don’t set goals that are too lofty such as trying to do 6 hours of reading in a day.  Try to mix up the tasks in every study session (some reading, some writing, some listening) so that any one task doesn’t get too monotonous.    Self-issue small rewards for getting each task done. E.g., “If I study for three hours, I can watch one hour of my favorite TV show”.  If applicable, you could also try to organize phone or video chats with peers to study in pairs or quiz each other on content.
