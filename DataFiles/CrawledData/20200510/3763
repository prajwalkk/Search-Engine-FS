Many of these initiatives spring from the Diversity Advancement Committee (DAC) , which is a branch of the department devoted to promoting diversity, and fostering an environment of respect and inclusion for all members of our community.  Since we are a research institution, many of our faculty are involved in active research that directly relates to diversity. See the Faculty Research page to learn more about this exciting work.  Overall, our focus on diversity and inclusion springs directly from our Mission Statement  .
