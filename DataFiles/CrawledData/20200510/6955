How can I attend my classes online?         How can I attend my classes online?   This summer, all Tutorium classes will be online using Blackboard ( https://uic.blackboard.com)  Class time will be a combination of synchronous and asynchronous. This means that sometimes everyone will be meeting together on video and sometimes students will do work on their own.  Teachers will give directions about when work is due and when students must be online.        Can I access American websites like Blackboard or Google Applications in my home country?         Can I access American websites like Blackboard or Google Applications in my home country?   We are not sure if Blackboard or Google Applications work in each country since some countries block different websites. Before you plan to return to your country, you may want to ask a family member to test it for you.  UIC offers free VPN software for students to connect to UIC securely. This VPN software has allowed employees who travel to countries like China to access Blackboard and Google. You will need to download the VPN software to your computer. You can view the download instructions here.  According to Blackboard, their Blackboard Collaborate tool is accessible in China. You can view information here.

They are allowing online learning from anywhere in the world for the spring semester only. They are allowing students to remain in the USA or return to their home country. The Tutorium, however, is recommending you do NOT travel or return home during this time. At the same time, we want you to be safe, and we understand any decision you make.  There are some items you need to consider if you plan to return home:   Online classes means you must attend online classes. As an international student, you still must attend classes (in this case, online classes) to remain in status.  Do you have access to the internet at home? How is your video and audio at home? Can you access Blackboard and Google? You need to think about how you will access your classes.  Blackboard does NOT work in all countries; for example, we know Blackboard (and Google) are not accessible in China. It will be harder to study if you cannot access Blackboard and Google.  Online classes may be part synchronous (teachers and students online at the same time). If you are in a different country, you may need to attend class early in the morning or in the middle of the night. Parts of classes may be asynchronous, you can complete assignments at any time by a certain deadline.  If you return to your country, you might be sent to a hotel or other place to live for 2 weeks before you can go home (quarantine). Each country has its own plans. Find out what your country is doing before you go home. Look at the embassy website for your country.

Normally, a signature is needed to travel before you leave; however, we can mail you a new I-20 if you do not receive a travel signature. If your I-20 expired or will expire, we can mail you a new I-20.  Email tutorium@uic.edu to find out what we can do for you.        I may NOT want to go back home.
