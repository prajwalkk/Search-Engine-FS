Graphic Design Daniel Mellis dpmellis@uic.edu  Industrial Design Nick Rummler nrumml2@uic.edu  Honorarium payments If you plan to invite a guest to your class and wish to provide an honorarium, you will need to submit the name of your guest to Itzel Lopez ilopez7@uic.edu prior to the promise of payment. Before you extend an invitation and schedule a visit, we need two weeks of payment research/verification time to confirm that your guest is considered payment eligible by the University. Please note that payments to foreign nationals, which are dependent on visa status, are not always possible. It is also important to alert your guests to the requests for paperwork that will come from the School office and to help them understand prompt completion of the forms is necessary for payment.  Faculty Reporting requirements  Report of Non-University Activities (RNUA) Your RNUA is due in September each year. This process is not intended to discourage non-University income producing activities. It is recognized that most of these activities are consistent with, and often beneficial to, your university role. The reporting and approval procedures assist in ensuring that external activities are compatible with University obligations. The RNUA form, instructions and FAQs are available on the website of the UIC Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research . The Policy on Conflicts of Commitment and Interest applies to all faculty and academic staff.  Statement of Economic Interest If you hold a university P-(purchasing) or T-(travel) card, you are required to file a Statement of Economic Interests (SOEI). The SOEI is sent in early April directly from the Illinois Secretary of State to your home address on file with the university. The Secretary of State sends reminders directly to all employees who have not filed a Statement. Should you need a blank form, it can be found online with the University Ethics and Compliance Office .  Ethics Training The State Officials and Employees Ethics Act requires you to complete ethics training each October. This is a web-based session that require successful participation in a series of questions as you progress through the training. Notifications and login details are sent directly from the University Ethics Officer just prior to the start of the training period. Be sure to note the deadline for completion. Failure to complete the training results in notification to the Office of Executive Inspector General for the Agencies of the Illinois Governor.  Sexual Misconduct Training As a University of Illinois employee, you are required to complete the Haven for Faculty and Staff module of this online training offered by the University of Illinois Office of Ethics and Compliance . Notifications and login details are sent directly from the University Ethics Officer just prior to the start of the training period in the spring semester.  Faculty Activity Report All full-time faculty in the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts are required to submit an annual Faculty Activity Report (FAR). This report is used to record and share your accomplishments, to compile reporting data on faculty activities, and potentially to determine merit-based salary increases. Use the online College Form to complete your FAR.
