We collaborated on many projects related to disability arts and to advocacy in the community. She was a frequent lecturer in our classrooms and a mentor to our faculty and students. Our students serve practicums at Access Living, and some have gone on to work there. She was also a friend to many in our department.  Marca was a leading advocate for disability rights — internationally, nationally and locally. Her work has made an incredible impact on improving the rights of people with disability. In the spirit of her tireless advocacy, we will continue our strong partnership with Access Living as we train future advocates in the field of disability.
