Students will earn both a BAUS and a MUPP degree upon completion, with 9 hours of course work shared between the two degrees.  The requirements for completion of the combined BAUS/MUPP degree are identical to the completion of these two separate degrees; however, there are 9 hours of shared course work used for both degrees. Completion of 111 hours at the undergraduate level; plus 9 shared hours counting toward both the BAUS and MUPP degrees; plus 51 hours of course work at the graduate level will result in joint BAUS/MUPP degrees. Students in the BAUS who have only two semesters of course work left and who have at least a 3.40/4.00 grade point average may register for up to three required MUPP courses usually taken in the first year of the graduate degree. The graduate-level courses taken in the senior year will be used at the undergraduate level to fulfill 9 hours of BA selective requirements. At the graduate level these courses will be required courses. An advisor must approve these courses.  Students may apply to the joint degree program when they enter as freshmen, but must comply with all other requirements for admission to the BAUS program and have an exceptional record; others may apply when they transfer or at any time before their senior year provided that they have a minimum GPA of 3.40. All students must have a minimum GPA of 3.40 upon completion of their BAUS course work, and must maintain an average GPA of at least 3.00 in all graduate courses. Should students accepted to the joint degree program fall below this average, they will be placed on probation for a semester and will remain in the program only if they bring their average back to the required minimum.
