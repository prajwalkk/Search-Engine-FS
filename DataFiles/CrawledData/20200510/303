Muthu Muthukrishnan Rutgers University Thursday, September 20, 2012 11:00 a.m., 1000 SEO Building        Abstract:   Systems have emerged in the past decade that enable advertisements (ads) on the Internet. Such Internet ad systems handle billions of transactions every day involving millions of users, websites and advertisers. They crucially rely on real-time auctions and optimizations, even while nearly all parties involved from marketeers to publishers strategize. In this talk, I will provide an overview of Internet ad systems and discuss challenges, with special emphasis on Ad Exchanges.       Bio:   S. (Muthu) Muthukrishnan is a Professor in Rutgers Univ. with research interest in databases and algorithms, recently on data stream management and in algorithms for Internet ad systems. This talk is based on work with the Doubleclick Ad Exchange and Market Algorithms at Google.
