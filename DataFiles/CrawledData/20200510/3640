Located a little west of the loop, we are a one-stop shop for your business resources. We offer professional development courses as well as custom corporate MBA programs. Our student project teams are available to help small businesses and larger companies with marketing strategy, research, app development, or website overhauls.  UIC Business is home to advanced research centers, including the Center for Research Information Management and the Institute for Leadership Excellence and Development, both of which provide the opportunity for corporate research partnerships that provide valuable insights for your business.  Contact us at BCC@uic.edu        Project Collaboration    Call for Projects  We seek support from companies that can offer our students an opportunity to work on a MIS project (IDS 406/IDS507) or a more generic business problem (MBA590). Similar to an internship, but without any financial payments or contractual obligations, we require only a commitment of approximately 1-2 hours per week from one or more individuals in the organization to serve as mentors for the student team (3-4 students per team).  Project Courses  IDS 406 is the capstone course for Information and Decision Sciences undergraduate majors, and runs for the 16-week duration of the spring or fall semester. The projects for this course focus on technology solution designs and implementations. Initially, the course instructors meet with the sponsoring organization to develop high-level expectations for their project. The student teams are then responsible for finalizing the scope of work and a work plan for their projects in conjunction with their mentors. At this first meeting, the teams will arrange for weekly or other as-necessary meetings with the organization in order to gather requirements and information for their projects. Depending on the specific requirements of the project, the students may need to be assigned some work space and resources at the organizational premises. The students also meet weekly in class with their instructor to report project status. The instructor closely interacts with the mentor to assess the progress made by the student teams and whether expectations are being met.  IDS 507 is the capstone course for Masters in MIS students. It also runs for the 16-week duration of the spring or fall semester, and focuses on technology solution designs and implementations as well as systems and data analyses.  MBA 590 is an elective course for the MBA and Masters in MIS programs. It runs for the last half of the fall and spring semesters. For the fall 2015 semester, it will run from October 19 through December 11. This course focuses on business issues such as strategy and modelling, process reviews, marketing program review and planning, and financial analysis and planning; although generally these projects also involve technology components such as business intelligence, software evaluation and selection, and mobile enablement planning.  Student Profiles  The undergraduate students in IDS 406 are seniors who are nearing the completion of their studies and have had courses in databases and programming.  The graduate students in IDS 507 are from the MS-MIS/MBA programs. They have completed business foundation courses and have had formal training in business and system analysis, databases, application development, enterprise applications (J2EE) and other MIS courses. Other coursework in the program includes business data mining, IT audit, operations and supply chain management, and corporate IT strategy. Many of the students have previous work experience in varied business and IT-related roles.  To participate, contact Kyle Cheek at kdcheek@uic.edu .
