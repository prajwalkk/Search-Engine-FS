Feb  06  2020   by UIC Alert     [URGENT] Public Safety Advisory   Posted in Public Safety  On Thursday, Feb. 6, at approximately 5 a.m., UIC Police received a report of an aggravated robbery at 1350 S. Halsted. A customer in the retail store was approached by an offender who donned a mask, implied he had a weapon and demanded the customer’s property. The customer refused to comply and was ordered out of the store by the offender. No weapon was displayed. The victim, who is not affiliated with UIC, exited the store with the offender who fled the scene with a female offender.  The first offender is described as a black male, approximately 6’ tall, 30 years old, 160-200 pounds, wearing dark clothing. The second offender is described as a black female, approximately 5’ 2” tall, 150 pounds, wearing dark clothing. The victim was not injured.  The Chicago Police Department will lead the investigation. Anyone with information should call 311.  Approximat e crime location mapped:  https://goo.gl/maps/Yputw5eGNaqAgHG4A  UIC Police offer the following security tips:   Be aware of your surroundings. Use all your senses to be alert for danger, and when walking alone, don't wear headphones or earbuds.  Don't display valuables in public.  On campus, look for the location of the nearest emergency call box (there are more than 1,500 across campus.)  To contact the UIC Police, call 312-355-5555 for emergencies or 312-996-2830 for non-emergencies.  Report crime promptly to police.   Public safety advisories are distributed to the university community in compliance with the federal Clery Act. UIC Police may also issue notifications for off-campus crimes in the interest of public-safety awareness. Security tips are standard precautions, not special or incident-specific measures. Offender descriptions and precise locations are provided only to aid in the identification of possible suspects. Updates to investigations are not sent by email but will be posted online at:  http://emergency.uic.edu/public-safety-advisory/  UIC Annual Security Report  http://www.clery.uic.edu  Chicago Police Department Crime Incidents  http://gis.chicagopolice.org/clearmap/startpage.htm  Urgent notifications may be sent via both INSTANT TEXT MESSAGE (SMS) and URGENT mass e-mails. SMS messages — issued only in cases of immediate threat to health and safety, such as a tornado alert, or a major disruption to travel — are faster and more reliable than e-mail. The campus strongly recommends that you register your cell phone for SMS messages at http://sms.uic.edu      Next Post  Previous Post        © Copyright 2015-2020 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois     Footer Navigation   Follow Us     Disability Resources  Emergency Information  Privacy Policy  Contact Us
