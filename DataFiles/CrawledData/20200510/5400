Its officers operate every day and night across three different shifts. Patrol officers can be seen touring the UIC area in police cars, on bikes, or on foot patrols. It is protocol for a Patrol Officer to be dispatched when someone calls our dispatch center.  Our patrol officers are here for your protection. Feel free to ask them questions, alert them of suspicious activity on campus, and call on them for help. Be sure to listen to them when they are directing you during campus events or emergency situations.
