The University of Illinois at Chicago, School of Design, offers the Master of Design (MDes) degree in Graphic Design and Industrial Design. The MDes is a two-year program focused on an independent masters research project that offers students the opportunity to explore a topic of inquiry with the potential to inform and shape disciplinary knowledge. Applicants who do not hold a bachelors degree in design may be eligible for the MDes Preliminary Year which provides a year-long course of study, customized per student, in preparation for the two-year MDes sequence.  Students applying directly to the two-year program are expected to demonstrate a record of professional experience in design and to present a considerable and significant portfolio of work. Students applying through the MDes Preliminary Year are typically seeking a career shift from relevant expereince in a non-design field. MDes Preliminary Year applicants are required to submit a standard two-year application designating a field of interest (Industrial or Graphic Design). During the MDes Preliminary Year, this choice of field will be confirmed or changed based on a student's evolving interest.
