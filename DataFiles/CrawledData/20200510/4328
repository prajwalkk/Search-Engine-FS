The Coordinated Program concentration focuses on the practice of nutrition (i.e., dietetics). Upon successful completion of the program, students are eligible to take the Registration Examination of the Commission on Dietetic Registration to become a Registered Dietitian (RD). The Nutrition Science concentration focuses on intensive study in biological and physical sciences as a basis for understanding the science of nutrition and the relationships between nutrients and human health. This track can be designed to meet the requirements for a didactic program in dietetics (DPD), so that students can apply for a dietetic internship after completion of the program.  The prerequisite course work listed below prepares the student to apply for either concentration in the Nutrition program offered in the College of Applied Health Sciences. Completion of the pre-nutrition course work does not guarantee admission to the College of Applied Health Sciences. Students admitted to the Nutrition program complete the final two years of course work within the College of Applied Health Sciences. Students admitted to the Coordinated Program concentration take an additional two semesters to complete the internship/practical (supervised experience) component.  Please see the Department of Kinesiology and Nutrition section of the catalog for more information about each concentration or visit the department website .  Sixty-three semester hours, exclusive of basic military science, distributed as follows:  Note: Students who do not place into certain courses or do not carefully plan sequential course work should expect to take summer session courses or take longer than two years to complete pre-nutrition course work. All prerequisite courses must be completed with a grade of C or higher.

General Education credit is given for successful completion of both CHEM 122 and CHEM 123 or CHEM 124 and CHEM 125 . e Completion of MATH 110 may be satisfied through placement exam.  The minimum GPA for application to the two programs in Nutrition is 2.50/4.00.  However, the average GPA for students admitted to the Coordinated Program is higher (currently 3.50). Students should contact the Department of Kinesiology and Nutrition for admission deadlines.
