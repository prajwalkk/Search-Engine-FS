02/28/2017 OIS NEWS - 05/24/2017 Coronavirus/COVID-19 Updates for the UIC International Community OIS NEWS - 5/08/2020 Pending LPR Immigration advice for all individuals  There are many variations in situations for people who are pending a  change to Legal Permanent Resident (LPR, a.k.a. “green card.”)  The  universal element is that you/your sponsor/your attorney have filed an  immigrant petition with USCIS.  All individuals must:   Maintain a valid passport at all times.    Report any change in residential address, within 10 days of moving, to the USCIS ( Form AR-11 ), to OIS by email ois@uic.edu , and in UIC’s NESSIE system.    Notify OIS if/when you receive and/or renew your EAD card, receive  an I-551 stamp indicating that you have been approved for permanent  residence, and obtain the actual Permanent Resident card (also known as  the “green card” or I-551 card).  We will need copies of these documents  to update and/or close your OIS file.   Other guidelines for all individuals    Dependents: May have an immigration status  different from your own depending on which documents were filed with  USCIS.  Consult OIS if we are your sponsor, or your attorney, if  self-sponsored.     Taxes: You are required to file both state and federal taxes.    Grace period: If you were maintaining status at the  time of filing the I-485 application, and were eligible to adjust your  status at that time, you may remain in the U.S. legally after your I-485  has been filed.  Filing the I-485 gives you permission to remain in the  U.S.    Departure: You are required to submit a Departure Verification Form upon leaving UIC.  This form is required regardless of your departure  reason:  departing the U.S., changing employers, or changing immigration  status.   Specific advice for two common Pending-LPR situations  There are two common Pending-LPR situations at UIC.  This information  is not inclusive of all possible situations.  Please consult with an  OIS advisor if you have additional questions about your status.   Specific advice for two common Pending-LPR situations      Maintaining   non-immigrant status  (H-1B,   O-1, etc.)   Utilizing   an EAD card    Explanation  Some   individuals choose to maintain their  non-immigrant status while their case is   pending with USCIS for LPR.   You must   maintain your underlying status in this situation.  Some   individuals choose to end their non-immigrant status to gain more flexibility   in regards to their work authorization.    Work   authorization  You   must work only as authorized by your  non-immigrant status and through the end   date on your current I-797  Approval Notice.    If you are an H-1B or O-1 sponsored by UIC, please  see your   corresponding section on our website.  Work   only for the period approved on your Employment Authorization Document (EAD card).    Extensions  Have   the department apply for renewal of  your status 4-6 months prior to the   expiration of your current  status.    Extension limits vary by situation, in general 3 years are  allowed for   individuals from an oversubscribed country (China, India,  etc.) and 1 year   extensions are allowed for all other situations.  Apply   for renewal of your EAD card 6  months prior to the expiration of your current   card.  EAD cards can be  extended in   increments of not more than one year at a time.    Travel  If you are an H-1B visa   holder, you may  travel on a valid H-1B visa stamp for as long as you have a   valid  I-797 Approval Notice.  You may   also choose not to use a visa to  re-enter but rather use Advanced Parole   (I-131).  In either situation,  you   resume your H-1B status upon re-entry unless you utilize an EAD  card for work   authorization.  Apply   for Advanced Parole (I-131) prior  to travel outside of the U.S. to avoid   abandoning the I-485 petition.   You   must have a current EAD card to continue to be work eligible upon  return to   the U.S.    Changing   jobs  You may be able to change  positions   and/or employers if the proposed new position is the same or  similar to your   current position.  Also, your approved Immigrant    Petition (I-140) can remain valid if Form I-485 is filed on the basis of  the EB   immigrant petition and remains unadjudicated for 180 days or  more.  Please consult OIS prior to accepting any   new position, if we  are your sponsor, otherwise contact your attorney/employer.  You   may change positions at your discretion.      xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
