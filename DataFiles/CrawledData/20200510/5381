Harrison Street. The call came in from the victim, a UIC student, who came into the parking lot office to report the crime. The offender displayed a handgun and demanded money from the victim. The victim gave him $30, after which the offender demanded that the victim lay on the ground while he went through her purse and stole her cell phone. The victim was not harmed. The offender then fled northbound from Lot 7 towards the Blue Line El station. The offender is described as a black male in his early 20s, slim build, dark complexion and wearing a grey sweatshirt, jeans and a ‘beanie’.  UIC Police will lead the investigation.

An ALL CLEAR has been declared for the campus; return to normal operations.   Posted in UIC Alerts   UIC ALERT: ALL CLEAR — The TORNADO WATCH for 3/14/19 has been cancelled. An ALL CLEAR has been declared for the campus; return to normal operations.         Mar  14  2019   by UIC Alert     TORNADO WATCH issued for Cook County until 5pm tonight. Conditions possible for tornadic activity. Seek shelter immediately if sirens are activated.   Posted in UIC Alerts   The National Weather Service has issued a Tornado Watch now until 5:00pm, Thursday, March 14th. Additionally, a Wind Advisory is currently in effect until 10:00pm Thursday, March 14th. The affected area includes northeastern Illinois, Cook County and the City of Chicago. Tornado Watch means conditions are possible for tornadic activity. Wind Advisory means that sustained winds of 30 mph and/or wind gusts of 45 mph are expected. Wind gusts of up to 50 to 55 mph are expected. Difficult travel, especially for high profile vehicles on north to south roads. Unsecured objects outdoors blown around. Minor tree damage and sporadic power outages possible. A tornado is a violently swirling column of air, a “funnel cloud” that stretches from the base of a thunderstorm down to the ground. Winds in excess of 200 MPH can crush sturdy structures, uproot trees, flip heavy objects like cars or utility poles, and create deadly flying debris. When the National Weather Service issues an official tornado warning, the City of Chicago will activate the outdoor warning system and broadcast an alert across the University campus. If you hear it or otherwise know a tornado warning is in effect, immediately take shelter. If you hear about an o­fficial warning: ­ *Remain calm: There is no guaranteed safe place during a tornado, but you will minimize your exposure by finding shelter in the best possible location. ­ *DO NOT wait until you see the tornado: Resist the temptation to go outside and check conditions for yourself. If you know of others in the building and severe weather warnings are issued, spread the word. ­ *Areas to seek: The safest place to be is an underground shelter, basement, or predesignated Storm Refuge Area. If no underground shelter or safe room is available, a small, windowless interior room or hallway on the lowest level of a sturdy building is the safest alternative. Crouch near the floor or under heavy, well-supported objects and cover your head. *If caught outdoors, drive to the closest shelter, take cover in a stationary vehicle, or lay in a depression and cover your head. *­Areas to avoid: Stay clear of windows, corridors with windows, or large free-standing expanses such as lecture halls or cafeterias. DO NOT use elevators during a tornado warning. ­ *Help others: Be mindful of class or workmates, family, or friends who may be hearing impaired or those who may not hear tornado warnings. *NEVER pull a ­fire alarm unless there is a fire. Otherwise, people may flee a relatively safe building and expose themselves to blowing debris.
