Daley                In April 1955 he took a sleepy, “nothing is happening” city and refused to let the rust-belt predictions of the times threaten for even another day. He generated a “can-do” mindset, enlisted corporate and labor leaders and made “no little plans.”  — Richard L.

The exhibit uses photographs, excerpts from oral history interviews, and video and audio clips about Richard J. Daley, one of the most powerful politicians in United States history. Daley was mayor of Chicago during a time when the city was challenged and energized by racial inequalities, job and population losses, decaying infrastructure, and financial decline. In Remembering Richard J. Daley, the mayor’s colleagues, friends, and family recall and evaluate these exciting and turbulent years. They offer their unique insight into Daley’s administration of the city from 1955 to 1976 and his role as head of the Cook County Democratic Party from 1953 to 1976.
