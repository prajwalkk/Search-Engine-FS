It is the responsibility of each and every applicant, candidate, and employee with a disability or handicap to submit a request for an accommodation pursuant to established procedures. UIC has no obligation to accommodate disabilities of which it is unaware or disabilities or handicaps not covered by federal or state law.  Requests based on medical conditions not qualifying as disabilities or handicaps under state or federal law may be granted or denied at UIC’s discretion. By considering a request or granting a requested accommodation based on a medical condition, UIC is not considering or regarding the employee as having a disability as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act, or a handicap as defined by the Illinois Human Rights Act.  Reason for Policy: State and federal law prohibits discrimination in employment against any individual because of her/his physical or mental disability. The Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5, et seq.) is the primary state law prohibiting disability discrimination in employment.  Similarly, the primary federal law protecting people with disabilities from employment discrimination is the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, amended in 2008.  Furthermore, the University of Illinois Nondiscrimination Statement and the Chancellor’s reaffirmation of UIC’s commitment to equal opportunity and nondiscrimination also drive the underlying rationale for the policy.  Minority Impact Statement: The policy does not have any disproportionate or unique impact on UIC’s minority students, staff, or faculty.  Who Should Read the Policy: All UIC personnel including all faculty, Academic Professional, Civil Service and contract employees.  Definitions: N/A  Procedures: View the relevant ADA procedures .
