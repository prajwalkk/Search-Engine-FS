In preparing "Seeing Chicago," Olowu spent time learning about Chicago and its connection to the arts, curating a collection of works derived from the MCA's holdings and other collections throughout the city. The result is a show that pairs Olowu sleek designs with paintings, photographs, sculptures and films, including works by the likes of Kerry James Marshall, Barbara Kruger and Henri Matisse.  https://www.timeout.com/chicago/art/duro-olowu-seeing-chicago    Contact  PIP  13129960563  pip@uic.edu     Date posted  Feb 24, 2020    Date updated  Feb 24, 2020                    UIC Logo        Programs for International Partnerships         Quick Links    Handbook    Life In Chicago    About UIC         Contact   Programs for International Partnerships  1253 S.
