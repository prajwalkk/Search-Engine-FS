Flow Cytometry Core  The FCC provides flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and small particle technology services to further advance scientific research.    High Throughput Screening Core  The High-Throughput Screening (HTS) facility offers users the ability to screen biological targets against a library, or subsets, of over 100,000 unique chemical compounds in a time-efficient manner. We offer assistance with many of the early drug discovery stages, including assay development and optimization, robotic screening, data analysis and interpretation, and hit validation. Users interested in structural biology can perform automated screening of their purified protein against hundreds of crystallization conditions.    Mass Spectrometry Core  Beyond making available state-of-the-art, user-friendly facilities and services, the laboratory enables education, methods development, and new applications development, designed to meet the fast-paced needs of researchers.    NMR Core  To facilitate access for researchers, staff and students to high sensitivity, high-resolution solution state NMR instrumentation for studies of protein function, biochemical processes, and natural products characterization projects. To provide competent and qualified training and education for students, postdocs, and staff to operate scientific instrumentation, to analyze and interpret complex data as well as devising proper techniques or approaches to conducting analytical studies or research. To advise and collaborate with researchers that wish to pursue projects such as fragment-based library screening/drug discovery, the analysis of metabolites, biofluids or mixtures as well as detailed studies that require structural biology or biophysics data.
