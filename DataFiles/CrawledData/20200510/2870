Importance of workshops and request details   Workshops are vital for continuing your education, meeting your wellness goals and identifying the important role that overall wellness has on your daily life.  We encourage all individuals and organizations whose members that want to live healthier, learn new skills, and support risk management to request any workshop that the Wellness Center offers! At this time, workshops are only available to students affiliated with the University of Illinois system.  We request that you submit a workshop request form 2 weeks prior to the requested date so we can ensure that your need will be met.  Please help us keep safety a top priority for our student presenters, we ask that you do not schedule a workshop later than 5 pm.  **To respect our student staff presenters we will not be taking in any workshops that are past the 2 weeks before the academic Finals date.  Every workshop is free, approximately 50 minutes long, and each UIC student attendee will receive a give-a-way!
