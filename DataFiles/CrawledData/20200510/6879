Most commonly defined as ‘research’, undergraduates are more accurately engaged in ‘field study’.  For many, this is their first time in the country.  Language and culture differences, adjustment to new configurations of identity and privilege, and the practicalities of gathering, disseminating, and completing a project in a very limited amount of time make this a challenging activity.  Delivering a result that demonstrates fair representation and no assumption is what makes for a successful project.  The Forum on Education Abroad has established Guidelines for Undergraduate Research Abroad that outline all of this to help both the student and their faculty mentor be successful.  Some examples of program portfolios that offer this exceptional opportunity:  THE SCHOOL FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAINING / WORLD LEARNING  This portfolio of study abroad programs offer thematic curricula supporting cultural immersion pedagogy. In addition to content coursework, students are prepared through a research methods and ethic course to complete an in-depth, field-based project known as the Independent Study Project (ISP).   In each case, the project involves conducting original fieldwork, giving a final presentation, and writing a formal research paper. Students are required to examine the ethics of their research and consider its impact on local communities. For samples of student ISPs, go to the SIT Digital Collections page.  For a list of programs by theme, go to the SIT search engine .  Themes include:   Climate | Environment  Development | Economy | Inequality  Global Health  Media | Arts | Social Change  Migration | Identity | Resilience  Peace | Human Rights | Social Movements   THE SCHOOL FOR FIELD STUDIES  This portfolio of programs is centered around environmental field studies and human ecology, with curricula anchored in 5 year research plans in 8 locations.  Examples of faculty and student research projects from Spring 2017 can be found here.  Each program and research station focuses on topics relevant to that specific location.   Biodiversity & Development in the Andes-Amazon… Peru  River Ecosystems & Environmental Ethics … Cambodia  Tropical Island Biodiversity Studies … Panama  Sustainable Development Studies… Costa Rica  Wildlife Management Studies… Tanzania  Himalayan Studies… Bhutan  Rainforest Studies… Australia & New Zealand  Marine Resource Studies… Turks and Caicos Islands    DIS: The Danish Institute for Study Abroad  DIS is a non-profit study abroad foundation established in Denmark in 1959 through affiliation with the University of Copenhagen. DIS has campus locations in Copenhagen and Stockholm and provides semester, academic year, and summer programs taught in English, offering high-impact learning experiences for upper-division undergraduate students.  DIS offers 25 semester program tracks many of which have research options. These opportunities include:    Become a Research Assistant  Fall & Spring, 3 Credits  Join an ongoing research project carried out by a DIS faculty member. As a research assistant, you collaborate closely with your mentor. By the end of your semester, you will grasp the complexities of the research process.
