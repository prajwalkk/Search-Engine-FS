PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY. This Notice of Privacy Practices (“Notice”) describes the privacy practices of the University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System (UI Health). It applies to the health care services you receive at UI Health, including its physicians, nurses, staff, and volunteers. UI Health is an academic environment; therefore, residents, medical students, nursing students, and students of other health professions may also use or disclose your protected health information. In this Notice, UI Health and all of its departments, units, health care providers, staff, volunteers, residents, students, and trainees are collectively referred to as “we” or “us.” We are required by law to give you this Notice of our privacy practices, legal responsibilities and your rights. We are required to follow the terms of this Notice or other notice in effect at the time we use or disclose your health information. This Notice also describes (i) the types of uses and disclosures we may make with your health information; and (ii) your rights to access and control your health. There are other laws that provide additional protections for certain medical information related to services or treatment for certain conditions including genetic testing, mental health, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, and HIV/AIDS. We will follow the requirements of those laws with respect to these types of medical information. WE MAY USE AND DISCLOSE INFORMATION FOR THE FOLLOWING PURPOSES Treatment: We may use or disclose your health information to provide treatment, and to coordinate, or manage your healthcare and any related services. For example, we give information to doctors, nurses, lab technicians, students, and others, including information from tests you receive and we record that information for others to use. We may provide information to other providers outside of the UI Health to arrange for a referral or consultation. Payment: We may use or disclose your health information, as needed, to obtain payment for our health care services. For example, we may contact your insurer to verify benefits for which you are eligible, obtain prior authorization, and give them details they need about your treatment to make sure they will pay for your care. We may also use or disclose your medical information to obtain payment from third parties that may be responsible for payment, such as family members. Healthcare Operations: We may use or disclose your health information, as needed, in order to perform healthcare operations. Healthcare operations include, but are not limited to: training and education, quality assessment/improvement activities, risk management, claims management, legal consultation, physician and employee review activities; licensing; regulatory surveys; and other business planning activities.

Fundraising: We may use and/or disclose to our Foundation, the University of Illinois Foundation, your name, contact information, and the dates of your care (but not your treatment information) to contact you about fundraising efforts. If you receive such a communication from us, you will be provided an opportunity to opt-out of receiving such communications in the future. Marketing Activities: We may use or share your health information to discuss products or services with you face to face or to provide you with an inexpensive promotional gift related to a product or service. For any other types of marketing activities, including sending you marketing materials, (excluding direct mail sent to targeted zip codes that are not based off patient lists) we must obtain your written permission before using or disclosing your health information. Directory Information: Unless you object, we will use and disclose in our facility directory – your name, the location at which you are receiving care, your condition (in general terms), and your religious affiliation. All of this information, except religious affiliation will be disclosed to people that ask for you by name, including the media. We will give your religious affiliation to clergy only, even if they do not ask for you by name. You may tell patient registration to keep your information out of the directory, but if you do florists and other visitors may not be able to find your room or contact you. Appointments and Services: We may use and disclose your health information to remind you of an appointment, or to give you information about treatment alternatives or other health related benefits or services that may interest you.
