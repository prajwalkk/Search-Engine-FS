One such disruption has been to delay production and mailing of the Spring 2020 issue of Affirmations.  We know many people look forward to reading Affirmations, so we are pleased to provide this online preview of the publication and hope that you find the content relevant and informative. The printed version of Affirmations will be mailed at a later date.
