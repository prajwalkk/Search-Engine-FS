Professionals    Integrated, problem-based and patient-centered curriculum combining clinical care with research and technology driven innovation.  The UIC College of Dentistry offers an innovative pre-doctoral degree program, the Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD). The program is designed to graduate oral health professionals with strong competencies in health promotion and disease prevention, diagnosis, evidence-based practice, communication, collaboration, and community engagement. This is a full time, year round four-year program with a fall term start.        Application Requirements     How to Apply     Get Admissions Alerts              Case-Based Curriculum  The DMD features small group learning that is interdisciplinary in nature and prompted through the use of clinical case studies developed by a team of COD faculty. These case scenarios place all learning in the context of a patient problem/concern and emphasize the relationship between systemic and oral diseases, health and prevention, family and community context, disease diagnosis and evidence based practice.  Small Group Learning  A central feature of the DMD curriculum is small group discussions. In addition to acquiring content knowledge, the goals of SGL are:  to develop students’ capacity to find and apply information relevant to clinical cases  to foster critical thinking and higher-order reasoning skills  to promote accurate self-assessment and a sense of responsibility for one’s own learning  to build effective communication skills and, collaboration skills.  To advance these goals, small group discussions must be skillfully facilitated to ensure that discussions remain on target. Our trained facilitators ensure that specified learning objectives are achieved and that the group dynamics are healthy and productive for all members of the group.
