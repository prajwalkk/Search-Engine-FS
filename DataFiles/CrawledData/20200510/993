In one summer I learned so much from so many people. I was able to immerse myself in a culture that is entirely different from my own. I was able to visit places that I never thought I would get to know. I also made lifelong friends that I can communicate with across an ocean. It was overall a very educational and unforgettable experience. – Cynthia Velazquez, Biological Sciences, French and Francophone Studies, Class of 2016      Home   Undergraduate Research Assistant (URA)    Undergraduate Research Assistant (URA) Interested in research? If so, the Honors College URA Program may be just what you are looking for! Honors College students who have completed their freshman year can participate formally in faculty research as a way of satisfying the honors activity requirement. UIC has a wealth of outstanding researchers, and the Undergraduate Research Assistant Program gives honors students an opportunity to work with some of them. The range of research activity is wide, including business, education, engineering, the humanities and the arts, the natural sciences and mathematics, and the social sciences. Undergraduate Research Assistants are expected to put in approximately six hours a week on a project that is part of, or relevant to, the faculty member’s research. The faculty will explain how the work done by the student fits into the larger project, and will make sure that the activity, whatever it is, has educational benefit for the students. Students who participate in the URA program should register for HON 225 when their URA application is submitted, and after arrangements have been made with a supervising faculty member. A directory of faculty/researchers, listing their research interests, is available through the Undergraduate Research Experience Website .
