This multi-disciplinary competition is open to any student enrolled in a graduate or professional degree program at UIC for the 2019-2020 academic year.  Through Sunday, May 31 , 2020 , graduate and professional students are invited to submit a static image or a moving image-based work that is evocative of their research. (Image could be created as part of the research process itself, or to represent a student’s research.)  Moving image entries are considered separately from the static image entries. Students may submit to both categories, but the images and the research they represent must be significantly different from one another.  A multi-disciplinary jury will review submissions and award prizes to the winning entries. Images will be judged on originality, relationship to the student’s research at UIC, and overall impact. An exhibit of the winners will be on display in the Richard J. Daley Library and the Library of Health Sciences. Winning entries will become part of the University Archives and will remain in an online gallery on the Graduate College website and in the Consortium of Academic and Research Libraries in Illinois (CARLI) database.  Still Image Category   1st Prize:  $500  2nd Prize: $300  3rd Prize:  $200  Honorable Mentions: $100   Moving Image Category   Winner – Animation: $400  Winner – Live Action: $400   Competition Guidelines:   Only one entry per person or collaborative group for each category (still and moving).  Entrant(s) must have been enrolled in a graduate or professional degree program at UIC for the 2019-2020 academic year.  Submission must have been generated as part of the student’s research within their graduate program at UIC, or to represent their research.  Entrant(s) must be principal creator(s) of image. Collaborative submissions are encouraged.  Submissions will be accepted through May 31, 2020 .  Entrants are responsible for ensuring that any relevant permissions have been sought, that no copyright has been infringed, and that any necessary release forms have been signed.  For static image entries:  Select one image that you think provides the best visual documentation of your research, and save it in TIFF format.  Your image file must be at 300 PPI with the longest side of the image measuring at least 10.25 inches (or pixel dimensions of 3000 x 2300 pixels). Select an uncompressed image file with the highest detail possible.  Do not artificially manipulate the size of your image in a photo-editing software as that will not improve the resolution. If you do not have a file of sufficient size/resolution, please try to take another photograph, perhaps use a better camera, or select a different image.  You will also be required to submit a .jpg copy of this same image file.  Panoramic images are not allowed.  Portrait orientation is strongly preferred over landscape. Winning images will be displayed on campus on large banners of size 72″ X 30″ (H X W).    For moving image entries:  Your submission must be no longer than two (2) minutes long (including credits). There is no minimum time, but winning submissions typically last longer than 60 seconds and have distinct beginnings and endings with some sort of story or arc in the middle.  Resolution must be at least HD-quality (1920x1080p).  If your moving image includes sampled audio, you should have copyright for the audio or use something under Creative Commons licensing.  Upload your video to an online resource for playing moving images (e.g. Youtube, Vimeo, etc.) and be sure to enable embedding so that it can be viewed through the Graduate College website. You will be including the URL to this in your submission.  If your video includes spoken words, it must have Closed Captioning enabled.    Your submission must include a 100-200 word description of your research and how the image you are submitting provides visual documentation of your overall work at UIC. This description must include, but is not limited to, an explanation of how the image relates to your research. You may also include such information as what the image represents (if it is not immediately apparent), and where and/or how the image was created.   Have you read the guidelines above carefully?  If you have questions, please contact Kevin Monahan .  Have a look at past Winners and Honorable Mentions .   Submit Here  You will be required to login using your NetID and password. The submission deadline is Sunday, May 31, 2020. Thank your for participating in this year’s competition!
