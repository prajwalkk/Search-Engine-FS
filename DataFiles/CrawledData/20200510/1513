Who is Eligible for GPIP?  Freshman Engineering and Computer Science students who are directly admitted into the College of Engineering in the Fall of the academic year.  The GPIP application will be available for the 2020-2021 academic year in fall 2020. Only new transfer and freshman students starting in the fall are eligible to apply.

What are the GPA requirements in order to qualify for GPIP?         gpa    You need a minimum 3.2 GPA for the Fall semester AND the Spring semester. A cumulative of 3.2 does not qualify you if you were under a 3.2 in either semester.  You need a minimum of a B for Calculus 1 & 2.  You need a minimum of a B for the required courses in your major. Required courses by major         How will I know if I end up on-campus or off-campus for my internship?         placement    If students prefer to do an off-campus internship at a company they will be required to apply for these internships. Opportunities to apply for off-campus internships will be provided by The Engineering Career Center.  Students are also encouraged to apply for internships that they learn about on their own through online searches and networking.  Off-campus internships WILL NOT be guaranteed.  If a student does not secure an off-campus internship and still meets the GPIP requirements, they will be placed in an on-campus internship.         When should I start applying for off-campus internships?         when   We suggest that you apply to off-campus internships throughout the school year until you secure an internship. While we will be alerting you to internship opportunities you can apply to, we have had several students secure internships on their own through online searches and networking.        Can I take summer classes if I am interning through the GPIP program?         classes    If you decide to take classes over the summer you will have to arrange your schedule with your internship supervisor.  Past GPIP participants found that it was easier to take summer classes at UIC while completing an on-campus internship.  If you obtain an off-campus internship, we strongly recommend not taking summer classes as most off-campus supervisors will largely expect their summer interns to work full-time hours.         Where will I be placed if I don't secure an off-campus internship?         on-campus   We do our best to place students in a research lab within their department. However, depending on project availability, you may end up in a research lab at UIC outside of your department, but still engaging in engineering-related work.        How long is the GPIP internship? What are the required work hours?         hours    For off-campus internships, the duration will be a minimum of eight weeks. Most off-campus internships require a full-time 40-hour work week.  For on-campus internships, you are expected to work 32 hours a week for eight weeks.         When do internships start?         start    Off-campus internships will start at the end of May or beginning of June depending on your site.  On-campus internships at UIC will start in mid-June.         How does CR/NC grading option affect GPIP eligibility in light of COVID-19?         test   Due to COVID-19, the College of Engineering is adjusting the eligibility requirements of our GPIP program.  To see the original requirements for GPIP, click here (for freshmen) or click here (for transfers).  Because students now have the option to take Credit/No Credit for any course this spring, the following changes have been made:   Prior to COVID-19 all GPIP mandated courses, including Calculus 180/181 and the specified courses for each major , required a grade of A or B.  This requirement is now A, B or CR (Credit).  Prior to COVID-19, a minimum GPA of 3.2 was required for fall and spring semester. This requirement is now a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.2 for the academic year 2019-20.         Will GPIP internships still occur in summer 2020?         test   We will know more in a few weeks, but currently it looks like most GPIP internships may need to be postponed until the next academic year or until summer of 2021. In a few weeks, when we expect to have more clarity about the prospects of being on campus this summer, our UIC Engineering research labs will be surveyed to see when they can host GPIP interns.  Some of the options currently being explored include:   Summer 2020 on-campus internship  Summer 2020 remote/online internship  Fall 2020 on-campus internship  Spring 2021 on-campus internship  Summer 2021 on-campus internship     The above options are just an example and this list might change.  For example, if we are able to go forward with some summer 2020 internships these might be shortened from 8 weeks to 5 weeks to provide a later start. After we hear back from our research labs we will send an email to each student eligible for GPIP asking you to rank order your top three choices on when you would like to have your internship.
