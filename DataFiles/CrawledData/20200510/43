We strongly encourage UIC CS students to sign up for hackathon competitions. Here are some reasons why:   Meeting new people. Not just potential employers—who might watch a hackathon for potential new hires—but also fellow students.  Developing your résumé. Hackathons let you showcase the skills you’ve developed in class and build some new ones.  Enhancing your job interviews. Hackathons make you a more interesting interviewee. You can talk about how you approached a problem, the solutions you considered, and which skills you brought to the table.  Winning! (Of course.)        More on hackathons     Hackathon honor roll         info here   UIC students have placed highly in these hackathon events:   BuiltWorlds Hackathon 2019: Riccardo Pressiani, Matteo Foglio, Guido Muscioni, Francesco Sgherzi, Chiara Gambacorta, and Giulia Soresini, Grand Prize  Google Tech Challenge 2019: 3rd place, 5th place  MIT Energy Hack 2018:  Chirag Soni, MS ’19  BuiltWorlds Hackathon 2018: Giovanni Agugini Bassi, Iacopo Olivo, and Francesco Pinci, all MS ’19  Mobility Hackathon Chicago: The Roiti (team of five MS ’19 students)              Research Experiences for Undergraduates      Research experiences for undergraduates —called REUs for short—offer undergraduate students the opportunity to complete career-building research projects over the summer. REUs are competitive (with students chosen for the research positions by application) and often are held at universities other than your home institution. They are sponsored with funding from the National Science Foundation and typically come with a stipend that you can use to cover living expenses and other costs.  REUs make excellent résumé entries and offer valuable hands-on experience that you can talk about in job interviews. If you have your eye on a master’s degree or PhD after graduation, REUs provide a head start on building your research experience and could give you insight on what you might like to pursue in graduate school.  Think of REUs as a great way to get research experience while trying out living in a different place.  Select current REUs (use the search function below to find more):   Advanced Secured Sensor Enabling Technologies at Florida International University (deadline: May 10, 2020)  Computer Networking at the University of Missouri (regular deadline: March 15, 2020)  Oakland University Undergraduate Computer Research (UnCoRe) program in Cybersecurity (deadline: March 15, 2020)  Secure and Privacy-Preserving Cyber Physical Systems at Tennessee Tech University (deadline extended to March 20)   The deadlines for these 2020 REUs have passed, but we are leaving them listed here in case you want to reach out to the sponsoring organizations to ask whether there is still an opportunity to apply.
