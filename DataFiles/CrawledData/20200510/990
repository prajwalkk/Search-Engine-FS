The UIC Institute for the Humanities will celebrate its thirty-eighth year of operation in 2020-2021. Founded in 1983, the Institute is one of the oldest humanities centers in the United States. Over the years the Institute has become the major hub for all humanities activities on campus creating an intellectual space in which faculty and graduate students can broaden their perspectives, conduct original research, and engage with scholars and communities both in and outside the university.    ***Dear Colleagues,  Given concerns over the COVID-19 spread, Institute for the Humanities is making alternate plans for the remaining events of the semester.
