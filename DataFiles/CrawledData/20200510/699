Centered at the gateway to Chicago's South and West Sides, UI Health is committed to providing high-quality, innovative health and wellness services to some of the nation's most diverse communities. As the state's only public academic health enterprise with seven health science colleges and diverse health professions programs, UI Health is uniquely positioned to train future healthcare leaders, pursue innovative research, and translate our expertise to compassionate patient care for neighborhoods across Chicago, communities throughout Illinois, and beyond. UI Health's commitment to the community is a responsibility to engage our patients and community partners to address health disparities in pursuit of health equity.  The UI Health community remains actively engaged with communities locally and across the state to design health interventions and practices that can improve the health and well-being of patients and their families. Some of the distinct programs and centers that are dedicated to activating communities to take control of their health are listed here - though may not be completely exhaustive.         Programs and Centers with Community Commitment     The University of Illinois Cancer Center         The University of Illinois Cancer Center   From bench to community.  The University of Illinois Cancer Center is the only public university-based cancer center in Chicago dedicated to the pursuit of health equity and study of cancer disparities. Our expert, multidisciplinary cancer focused physicians and researchers are dedicated to applying innovative breakthroughs for patient care from the bench to bedside to the delivery of treatment and clinical trial options to our community.        Mile Square Health Center Community Board (Community-based Practice)         Mile Square Health Center Community Board (Community-based Practice)   The Office Community Based Practice (CBP) aims to involve community members, community based organizations, local agencies, researchers, and other stakeholders as partners in the mission to foster equitable access and delivery of comprehensive, quality care for all Chicagoans seeking care at the Mile Square Health Centers (i.e., health care screenings, preventive consultation, diagnostic services, and treatment) and affiliated clinics through research, evaluation, and learning. The overarching goal of CBP is to eradicate health inequities, promote continuum of care, and improve health outcomes.        Community Engaged Research and Implementation Science (OCERIS)         Community Engaged Research and Implementation Science (OCERIS)   The UI Cancer Center’s Office of Community Engaged Research and Implementation Science (OCERIS) is a unique population health program that employs an evidence-based approach to community engagement. The OCERIS team carefully investigates the needs of our community members and develops services based on those necessities. Patients are then navigated to those services to ensure positive health outcomes.    We are able to best serve the community by becoming a part of it. We do this by leading a strong network of internal and external strategic partnerships with local and national community and health organizations, non-profits, and public health administrations. These relationships offer a wealth of resources for medical and social support, financial and legal assistance, spiritual guidance, and in some cases, just another outlet for our patients to be surrounded by others like them, who are suffering from cancer. By collaborating with internal UIC departments, OCERIS is able to provide the most accurate collection of data to investigate each part of the community that is served. This translates to patients being aware of opportunities for clinical trials and access to cancer care that is so desperately needed.        The Office of Community Engagement and Neighborhood Health Partnerships (OCEAN-HP)         The Office of Community Engagement and Neighborhood Health Partnerships (OCEAN-HP)   OCEAN-HP supports unique partnerships that enliven the mission of the University of Illinois at Chicago and engage community-serving organizations in cooperative efforts to improve Chicago communities. OCEAN-HP has a campus-wide focus that extends to all UIC colleges.  We focus on developing, facilitating and sustaining viable and mutually beneficial campus-community partnerships.    Our major areas of concentration include:   Health professional and lay health worker education  Consumer health and wellness education  Community-engaged research, research dissemination and implementation  Community-based health services including primary and behavioral healthcare services         Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA)         Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA)   UI Health has performed two community health needs assessments in recent years. These 2013 and 2016 reports identify and prioritize the health needs in the communities we serve, and include discussion of physical and mental health conditions, challenges in accessing care, and the social and economic factors that impact health.
