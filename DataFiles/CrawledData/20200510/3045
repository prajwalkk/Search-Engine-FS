UIC graduate students conduct cutting-edge research on ecologically sustainable farming techniques in southern Mexico, Ming dynasty porcelain kiln production in Fujian Province, China, and vascular neurogenic niche in stroke victims; they teach foundational courses in the humanities and laboratory sciences; and they help to run some of our academic units – to enumerate a few examples. In short, they are vital to the success of our university and of our society.  The Graduate College currently offers approximately 250 scholarships, fellowships, and awards each year, including to the three students’ projects above. Your expertise, mentorship, career counseling, or financial investment would allow us to sustain and grow our initiatives, which attempt to reach all of UIC’s approximately 8,000 master’s and doctoral students.  Additional funding is crucial for sustaining and expanding our initiatives. You can help!

Alternative Ways to Give     Become a Mentor         Become a Mentor   Fellows Mentoring and Support Initiative  The purpose of the Graduate College’s Fellows Mentoring and Support Initiative is to expand outreach efforts to Diversifying Faculty in Higher Education in Illinois and Abraham Lincoln Fellowship recipients. The goal is to provide fellows with career and personal mentoring, advice, and referral support in order to promote successful completion of their graduate degree and to pursue their career objectives. Alumni working in academic, non-profit, industrial, and corporate settings are invited to engage in mentorship relationships. We seek alumni with PhDs in all disciplines who can provide additional feedback to doctoral candidates with respect to dissertation research, degree progress, training, and employment opportunities. A matched pair design will be used whereby an alumna/us is matched with a mentee in a related academic discipline or field. We ask for a one-year commitment. Mentorship can be virtual via video conference, telephone, email, etc. The Graduate College will offer initial training and will monitor progress towards academic and professional goals twice each year. Alumni are also invited to present on topics germane to their professions and mentoring. We hope you’ll join us in this effort.  For more information, please contact Lunaire D. Ford, PhD , Assistant Dean , via email or telephone (312) 413-2556.             Give Expertise     Give Expertise         Give Expertise   Career and Professional Development Outreach Opportunities  What do you wish someone had told you when you were in graduate school? We would love for Graduate College alumni to come back and share their knowledge and experience with our current graduate students. There are a variety of opportunities for sharing expertise and guidance. We are seeking guest speakers and discussion leaders to lead brown bag talks and conversations, as well as individuals to take part in career panels whereby alumni share information about what it is like to work in their particular fields. Lastly, we are seeking workshop presenters. Are you excellent at networking or great at public speaking? Do you manage time well, multi-task and organize information, or possess other strong professional skills? Workshop presentations provide alumni with the opportunity to share their knowledge in a class format with students as part of single or multiple sessions. Any additional ideas or suggestions are greatly appreciated. We look forward to hearing from you!

Host an Intern     Host an Intern         Host an Intern       The Graduate College is currently investigating how it can better serve as an intermediary for current graduate students wanting or needing internship experience. Alumni could help us to facilitate these connections through networking and alerting us to internship opportunities hosted by their employer.  For more information, please contact Benn Williams , Assistant Director of Interdisciplinary Programs and Development , via email or telephone (312) 413-2389.                 Establishing a Memorial/Tribute     Establish a Memorial/Tribute         Establishing a Memorial/Tribute   Commemorative gifts are a thoughtful means of honoring or memorializing a family member or a beloved faculty/staff member. There are several ways to establish a memorial or tribute gift: make an outright gift; make a bequest in your will; and/or set up an endowment to fund a special program in perpetuity.  For more information, please contact Benn Williams , Assistant Director of Interdisciplinary Programs and Development , via email or telephone (312) 413-2389.               Endow a New Initiative     Endow a New Initiative         Endow a New Initiative   Leave a legacy! Of all the forms of private giving to higher education, endowments offer the most influential investment in the lives of future graduate students.  In an endowment fund, the principal is invested in perpetuity with a portion of the investment’s earnings spent according to the donor’s wishes. The remainder of the earnings return to the endowment to provide a growing, long-term source of funding. Endowments may be either restricted or unrestricted.  An endowment can be created through an outright gift, through a bequest in a will, or through a life income gift such as a charitable gift annuity or a charitable remainder trust. To minimize administrative costs, the minimum amount required to establish a permanent endowment account is $25,000. Lesser amounts are sometimes accepted.
