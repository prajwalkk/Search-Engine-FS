Hazard mitigation is the effort to reduce loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters. It is most effective when implemented under a comprehensive, long-term mitigation plan. Mitigation plans are crucial in limiting the impact of disasters, the reconstruction, and repeated damage.  An HMP enables UIC to:   Advance education and awareness programs on existing threats, hazards, and vulnerabilities  Strengthen partnerships with government agencies, organizations, businesses, and the public, related to risk reduction  Identify long-term, broadly-supported strategies for risk reduction  Align risk reduction with other state and local community objectives  Identify implementation approaches that focus resources on the greatest risks and vulnerabilities  Communicate priorities to potential funding sources   The HMP consists of a general 4 step process:   Organize the planning process and resources;  Assess risks;  Develop a mitigation strategy; and  Adopt and implement the plan   The campus will engage in hazard mitigation planning in 2019 to better identify risks and vulnerabilities associated with natural disasters, and develop long-term strategies for protecting the campus community from future hazard events.
