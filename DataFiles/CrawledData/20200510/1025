| University of Illinois at Chicago                                 Earth Day 2020: Plastic-Free UIC                       Wear Red. Take Action!   From the food we eat to the packaging our vendors use, UIC makes strides every day toward minimizing the amount of garbage we send to the landfill. Even though UIC sends 47% of all our trash to recycling or compost, we still have work to do to reach our Zero Waste goal, especially when it comes to the disposable, single-use plastics that are still widely used and distributed on our campus every day.  In honor of the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, we hope you’ll join us in advocating for a Plastic-Free UIC throughout the month of April by wearing red, drafting a zero waste policy, and participating in our virtual “clean up”!
