These minors require between 18 and 20 semester hours, independent of any prerequisite courses.  Minors are available to engineering students as well as students in UIC’s other undergraduate colleges: the College of Liberal Arts and the College of Business. They are a great way to diversify your undergraduate degree and add specificity in an area of engineering that interests you.  Follow the links below for the course catalog pages on each minor. If you are thinking about pursuing a minor, contact your academic advisor to ensure that you meet the requirements and to coordinate these courses in your schedule.      minors           Minor in civil engineering             Minor in environmental engineering             Minor in materials engineering              Undergraduate    Back to main content           Admitted Students    Admissions    Accreditation    Civil Engineering Major    Courses    Minors    Internships and Jobs    Student Groups    Student Profiles    Student Resources                   UIC Logo         College of  Engineering           Quicklinks    Graduate Resources    Undergraduate Resources    Room Reservation Form    ABET Accreditation         Contact   Department of Civil and Materials Engineering  2095 Engineering Research Facility, 842 W.
