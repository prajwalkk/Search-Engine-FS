We are a student-run engineering organization at the University of Illinois at Chicago centered around the task of designing, building, and competing race cars. These competitions contain tasks that challenge not only the dynamics and reliability of the vehicles, but the management and documentation of the team as well. It is these challenges that ultimately give us the engineering and problem-solving experience that is invaluable in our search for greater careers beyond the classroom.      UIC Motorsports competes in both the Baja SAE® and the Formula SAE® competitions held each year. In addition to these competitions, the program here at UIC takes part in many outreach opportunities including K-12 school lectures, STEM events, company visits, and a booth at the Chicago Auto Show.                     Baja      Baja is our longest running program here at UIC Motorsports. With a long and solid history of designs, competitions, and wisdom passed down, we take on the treacherous courses at multiple international competitions without fear.

From custom circuit boards, to hand-laid carbon fiber, to fearless drivers, we pull out all the stops to prove ourselves out on the pavement.     Learn About Formula         Society      Alongside these engineering challenges, we face the challenge of preparing ourselves and fellow students for the professional world. Along the way, taking time to visit students in elementary school through high school to show the coming generation the opportunities that lie within programs like ours.     Join Us!         Outreach      We hold a great debt to the companies and programs that make these opportunities available to us through various contributions and dontations.
