E. Uslenghi, PhD Program Coordinator: Carolyn C. Williams    The UIC College of Engineering offers a Master of Engineering degree program, which is completed online. The MEng is a professional degree based exclusively on course work, without a research component (no project or thesis) and without departmental affiliation. This program is fully approved by the Illinois Board of Higher Education.  The main objectives of the MEng online program may be summarized as follows:   To provide graduate training that is controlled by the employer’s needs, and may respond to these changing needs in real time by creating new specializations with no delay.  To provide graduate engineering education to students in remote areas of the state, the country, and the world, and/or to students who can access instruction only asynchronously.  To provide interdisciplinary technical upgrading to engineers in small and medium-sized industries.  To provide specialized technical training to a (possibly geographically dispersed) group of students.   All students must complete a minimum of 36 semester hours of graduate course work with a 3.00/4.00 GPA. All degree requirements must be completed within six years of admission. Of the 36 semester hours, all students are required to take the following two core courses: MENG 400 and MENG 401 .  There are five certificates that the Master of Engineering degree program offers. Certificates are based on completion of three courses only:   Bioinformatics Certificate (3 courses)  Disaster Management Certificate (3 courses)  Electromagnetics Technology Certificate (3 courses)  Engineering Law and Management Certificate (3 courses)  Wireless Communications Technology Certificate (3 courses)   Admission Requirements   Degree Requirements Entering students must have received a baccalaureate or equivalent degree in an appropriate field of engineering or in a closely related field (such as biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, or physics) from a recognized institution of higher learning.  Grade Requirements A cumulative grade point average of at least 3.00/4.00 for the final 60 semester hours (90 quarter hours) of undergraduate study is required for admission to the MEng program.  Note: Applicants who do not meet the admission qualifications, but whose professional experience in engineering might otherwise qualify them for entry into the program, may petition the Governing Committee for special consideration.  English Fluency Requirement Students whose native language is not English must demonstrate fluency in written and spoken English by passing one of the following: the TOEFL exam, IELTS (International English Language Testing System) exam, or the PTE-Academic.
