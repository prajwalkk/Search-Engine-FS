The vocabulary and the context in which it is used are often contested. The UIC Study Abroad Office is proud to support one of the most diverse student populations that embark on overseas educational opportunities. We are dedicated to supporting students from diverse backgrounds including, but not limited to, categories of race/ethnicity, socio-economic background (e.g. financial need, first generation), physical ability, sexual orientation, and gender identity. The idea and definition of being a minority shifts and is interchangeable with the country in which you may find yourself. Your self-perception may also change based on how your host culture views you. Following is an alphabetical list of resources for students, parents, and advisors which can be used as a starting point for information. This is not an exhaustive list but will begin to hopefully place some of these topics into the study abroad environment.  Anti-Americanism Abroad  This article ,  Opportunity, Not Threat: Dealing With Anti-Americanism Abroad , argues that “Although a strengthening anti-Americanism in many parts of the world does require appropriate risk assessment, it should present invaluable teachable moments for education abroad programs.”  Brown University Diversity Handbook  Diversity Issues in Study Abroad “A collection of quotes by Brown University students about their experiences abroad. The quotes were gathered through a survey that directly addressed issues of diversity including ethnicity, heritage, sexual orientation, religion, minority/majority issues, physical appearance, and language.”  Mobility International USA  Empowering people with disabilities around the world to achieve their human rights through international exchange and international development.  NAFSA: Association of International Educators Rainbow Special Interest Group  NAFSA has compiled a list of resources that focus on the benefits and challenges of GLBTQ study abroad students. This site contains information bibliographies, websites, and organizations.  The Race Project  Looking through the eyes of history, science (human variation), and lived experience, the American Anthropological Association (AAA) RACE Project explains differences among people and reveals the reality – and unreality – of race. “Racism is not about how you look, it is about how people assign meaning to how you look.” – Robin Kelley, Historian  Supporting Diversity in Study Abroad  At this website , students, advisors and parents will find information useful in promoting study abroad participation among underrepresented students, addressing some of the issues and challenges ethnicity may play in their study abroad experience.  Among other resources, the website offers a “ten best reasons to study abroad” list for African-Americans, for Asian Americans, for Hispanic Americans, and for Native Americans.  UIC Centers for Cultural Understanding and Social Change  The Centers for Cultural Understanding and Social Change (CCUSC) are a collaborative group of seven centers with distinct histories, missions, and locations that promote the well being of and cultural awareness about underrepresented and underserved groups at UIC. The Centers’ collective purpose is to expand cultural understanding by providing opportunities for intercultural engagement among students, faculty, staff, and Chicago communities.
