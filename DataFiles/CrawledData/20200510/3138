This  is intended for people who are ineligible for a  social security number.  For more information, visit the Illinois DMV , or view the Department of Homeland Security’s Fact Sheet on applying for a driver’s license.     Can I apply for an Illinois Driver’s License without a SSN?  A Social Security Number is not required to obtain a State of   Illinois Drivers License. Internationals (F-1, F-2, J-1, J-2, among   others) in Illinois may obtain a Temporary Visitor Drivers License (TVDL) from various locations in the state. To apply, you will need to visit   the Social Security Administration to request a letter stating that you   are not eligible for an SSN, this is known as a Form L-676. If,  however,  you are eligible for a SSN, then you must apply for and  receive the SSN  before applying for a state driver’s license.    International Driver’s Permit   An IDP allows an individual to drive a private motor vehicle in   another country, only when accompanied by a valid driver’s license. It   is a recognizable form of identification valid in over 150 countries .    Using Home Country Drivers License while in Illinois  The Illinois Secretary of States Office provides guidance on the use of your home country drivers license while you are in Illinois.     xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
