Advising   We strongly encourage you to meet with faculty members whose work most interests you. It’s helpful to include their names, up to four faculty, in your Statement of Academic Interests and to explain why their research program align with your goals.

Have your test scores sent in advance  Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores are required for all applicants. Scores should be sent directly from Education Testing Service to UIC.

The Graduate College has some great information on financial resources and funding opportunities.  Graduate assistantships are the primary means of financial support for PhD students. The department offers appointments in both teaching and research (or a combination of both). Assistantships are competitive and many are awarded at the time of acceptance into the program, so you should submit your materials early for full consideration.  Other assistantship opportunities may arise during the year. These are sometimes advertised on the student mailing list, but you can also find opportunities by maintaining contact with faculty or other staff members. Although opportunities vary, most have a direct connection to a student’s academic work and help to prepare them for the future.
