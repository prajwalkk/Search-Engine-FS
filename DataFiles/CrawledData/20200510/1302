There are two apps for Blackboard users. The Blackboard app is available for students to receive mobile updates, participate in course-related activities, and view grades. The Blackboard Instructor app allows instructors to view the course content, grade assignments, and use Blackboard Collaborate.

It may take up to 48 hours for new student enrollments to be reflected in course sites.  ACCC creates Blackboard course sites for most CRN-related courses, as reflected in the course catalog, 60 days prior to the start of every semester. Sites are made unavailable to students by default, and instructors determine when to make their courses available.  Instructors can:   Request content to be copied from a previous course site or copy the content by themselves from previous teaching assignments.  Build a custom site by adding their own course menu items or by requesting an exemplary course shell template to be imported into their course site.   In special situations, instructors can:   Request the merge of course sections  Request a Non-CRN related site   With Blackboard Learn, instructors can:   Create or upload text, audio, video, and interactive content for students to access online. Content can be added using Blackboard Learn tools or using third party software that integrates with Blackboard. You should always create content that is accessible to all students. Below are the most common sources of content:  Text, audio, or video directly added into a content area using the Blackboard Learn Content Editor tool  Video creation and screen capture using Panopto  Lecture capture content via Echo360  Multimedia content via the Blackboard Learn Mashups tool  Interactive content using Adobe Captivate 9 and other eLearning authoring tools  Recorded webinar content using Blackboard Collaborate  Slides, documents, quiz questions, and other resources from course cartridges that publishers make available as part of textbooks    Communicate, interact, and collaborate with students via course announcements, email, discussion board threads, blog posts, and other collaboration tools  Assess concept mastery through the use of tests , assignments , and other tools that enable instructors to record and assess students’ work in a variety of ways. A Grade Center column is created automatically when an assessment is created, and grades are populated as instructors grade assignments. The Grade Center can be configured to export final grades in the format required for the XE Faculty Grade module   Learn more about the benefits of using Blackboard by watching the Why Blackboard video (2:19).
