ARC's Safe & Well            Safety tips to navigate the campus     Navigate the campus at night   When navigating the campus at night there are steps you can take to enhance your personal safety, including:   Be aware of your surroundings and identify the safest route to your destination.  Always avoid walking alone. Try to travel in groups, when possible.  Look for the location of the nearest emergency call box (there are more than 2,000 across campus).  Become familiar with university confines and the neighborhood and know how to navigate it safely.  Walk on well-lit sidewalks and pathways.  Do NOT use headphones or earbuds while walking; music can be a distraction from hearing an individual or a group approaching from behind.  Stay sober. Those who are under the influence of drugs and alcohol can be more vulnerable to would-be thieves or predators.  Whether you live on- or off-campus, it is important to remember to lock doors and windows when you are away.  Always have a charged cell phone and emergency cash.  Always have emergency contacts on you or in your mobile device.  Remember — A crime-free campus requires that everyone report suspicious activity by calling the UIC Police and report conditions that make crime possible.      Safety Tips when coming to, or from, classes:    Whether you’re parking on the street or in a city parking lot, be sure to lock your car.  Keep all valuables out of sight.  Always be aware of your surroundings. Self-awareness is crucial!  Try to use “the buddy system” when exiting the building, particularly after dark.  When walking to your vehicle, have your keys ready in hand.  Notify friends or family of your whereabouts and plans.  If you notice anything suspicious or potentially dangerous, please inform a staff member immediately. If you are in the parking lot area and in need of emergency assistance, call 911.
