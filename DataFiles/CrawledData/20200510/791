The Department of Education has allocated $14.9 million for this grant through the CARES Act. In addition to the Department of Education funding, UIC has transferred $1 million from the Federal Work-Study Program as allowed by the federal government to supplement the emergency grant funding for any student eligible for Title IV Financial Aid funding.  Undergraduate, graduate and professional students enrolled in the Spring Semester will be eligible to receive up to $1,000, if you have:   Filed a FAFSA and submitted all required documentation to the Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships prior to 3/13/2020;  Been enrolled in an in-person, degree-seeking program prior to 3/13/2020 and remained enrolled through the semester;  Been enrolled at half-time status or greater during Spring Semester 2020:  Undergraduate Students = 6 credits or above  Graduate Students = 5 credits or above  Professional Students = 6 credits or above     Pell eligible undergraduate students enrolled in Summer Semester will be eligible to receive up to an additional $1,000, if you have:   Filed a FAFSA and submitted all required documentation to the Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships prior to 3/13/2020;  Received a Pell grant in Spring;  Enrolled at half-time status or greater during the Summer semester after the add/drop period; half-time status for Summer = 5 credits or above.   The grants may cover expenses such as food, housing, course materials, technology, health care, and child-care.  Because funding is limited, awards will be made on a first-come, first-served basis as follows:  An application is required to receive a grant. If you are eligible for the COVID-19 Emergency Grant, your portal at https://my.uic.edu/uPortal/f/welcome/normal/render.uP has been updated with a document for you to complete and upload . You should have received an email notification informing you that the requirement is posted. Please complete the document immediately as applications will not be accepted after May 8, 2020.  If you do not meet the eligibility criteria for the COVID-19 Emergency Grant, you can apply for other Emergency Grant programs available at UIC, such as:   U and I Cares Emergency Grant through the Dean of Students Office.  Graduate College Emergency Grant through the Graduate College.   To assist with questions, we have developed an FAQ on the UIC COVID-19 Emergency Grant at https://financialaid.uic.edu/faq/  If you have questions about this program, please contact the Financial Aid counselor assigned to your college of study at https://financialaid.uic.edu/faq/contact-us/  Sincerely,  Michael Amiridis Chancellor  J. Rex Tolliver Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs   Please note: UIC John Marshall Law School students may be eligible for the Law School’s AccessLex-Sponsored and CARES Act Emergency Fund. The Law School received separate funds from the Department of Education and therefore law students are not eligible for UIC COVID-19 Emergency Grant Awards.
