Students who want to apply for admission to the University of Illinois College of Medicine must complete a bachelor’s degree by the time of matriculation.  The table below lists the minimum course work required to apply for admission to the University of Illinois College of Medicine :   Course List         Code  Title  Hours     Required Courses  a  BIOS 110 Biology of Cells and Organisms b 4  BIOS 120 Biology of Populations and Communities b 4  Select one of the following general chemistry sequences: 10  CHEM 122 General Chemistry I Lecture c  CHEM 123 General Chemistry Laboratory I b,c  CHEM 124 General Chemistry II Lecture c  CHEM 125 General Chemistry Laboratory II b,c  OR  CHEM 116 Honors and Majors General and Analytical Chemistry I b  CHEM 118 Honors and Majors General and Analytical Chemistry II b  CHEM 232 Organic Chemistry I 4  CHEM 233 Organic Chemistry Laboratory I 2  Select one of the following courses: 3-4  BIOS 352 Introductory Biochemistry d  OR  BIOS 452 Biochemistry I (prerequisite of CHEM 234 - Organic Chemistry II) d  Select one of the following sequences: 8  PHYS 131 Introductory Physics for Life Sciences I b  PHYS 132 Introductory Physics for Life Sciences II b  OR  PHYS 141 General Physics I (Mechanics) b  PHYS 142 General Physics II (Electricity and Magnetism) b  Select three Behavioral/Social Science courses in the following disciplines: anthropology, economics, gender studies, psychology, or sociology. Two of the courses must be in the same field of study. Students can consult the U of I College of Medicine for more information.  e 9-10  Select at least one additional 200-, 300-, or 400-level biology course. Recommended topics include: biochemistry, physiology, cell biology, comparative vertebrate anatomy, or molecular genetics courses.  f 3-5  Recommended Courses  g  MATH 110 College Algebra  STAT 101 Introduction to Statistics  or STAT 130 Introduction to Statistics for the Life Sciences  PSCH 100 Introduction to Psychology  SOC 100 Introduction to Sociology  or SOC 105 Social Problems  Total Pre-Medicine Required Hours 47-51  Approximate Total Recommended Hours 58-69    a Students completing a bachelor’s degree at UIC must fulfill all the requirements of an undergraduate degree program, including General Education requirements. Students should consult their college and department sections of the catalog for information on completing their degree programs, including General Education requirements. b These courses are approved for the Analyzing the Natural World General Education category. c Each of the following pairs of courses will be considered one course in meeting the LAS General Education requirements: CHEM 122 / CHEM 123 ; CHEM 124 / CHEM 125 . d One course of introductory biochemistry may substitute for the second semester of organic chemistry. However, this substitution may not be accepted by other medical schools. Students who complete biochemistry in place of Organic Chemistry II must complete an additional upper-level biology course. e Students completing a bachelor’s degree at UIC should consult the General Education section of the catalog and their academic advisor to select courses in anthropology, economics, gender studies, psychology, and/or sociology that are approved for General Education. Two of the three courses must be in the same field of study. f Although not required, it is recommended students take biochemistry in addition to the required courses above as the subject is integrated into the MCAT exam. Students who selected biochemistry in place of a second semester of organic chemistry must complete another 200+ level course in biology. g These courses reflect subject areas covered in depth on the MCAT exam. Though not required, it is recommended that students complete these courses prior to taking the MCAT exam.  In addition to the course work listed above, applicants to the College of Medicine must take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) and apply using the centralized application services (AMCAS or AACOMAS) sponsored by the Association of American Medical Colleges and American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine. The MCAT should be taken after completion of the minimum pre-medical course requirements. Students are encouraged to prepare thoroughly before taking the exam, as scores from all MCAT exams taken will be released to medical schools upon application. It may be helpful to complete courses outside of the prerequisites in order to expand knowledge, gain experience, and to establish and strengthen critical-thinking and reasoning skills. Students may obtain a list of UIC courses that have an emphasis on health care to help them apply various health related topics across disciplines. Courses in integrated health studies, economics, psychology, sociology, anthropology, English, and philosophy may be of benefit to students as well. Students taking the MCAT exam are strongly encouraged to take courses in biochemistry, statistics, psychology, and sociology.  Students may obtain information regarding the MCAT and AMCAS by attending a workshop sponsored by Pre-Health Advising in LAS. Individual appointments with a pre-health advisor are available to students who have reached sophomore standing or higher. Until that point, students are encouraged to watch one of many webinars available on demand by Pre-Health Advising or meet with an LAS advisor. First-year students are required to meet with an LAS advisor prior to registering for fall and spring semesters during their first year. Students are advised to declare a pre-health educational goal upon entering UIC, which will alert them to specific workshops and add them to a Pre-Health Advising BlackBoard page with other pertinent information.  The list of courses above includes the minimum course work required for application to the University of Illinois College of Medicine. Specific admission requirements of other medical schools are listed in Medical School Admission Requirements , which is published by the Association of American Medical Colleges and can be ordered through their website.  Association of American Medical Colleges 655 K Street NW, Suite 100 Washington, D.C. 20001-2399  Most medical schools, including the University of Illinois, will only accept students with bachelor’s degrees. However, students admitted to a college of medicine prior to completion of the bachelor’s degree may be eligible to receive the baccalaureate upon satisfactory completion of the first year in a U.S. accredited medical school. The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences accepts a total of 32 semester hours of credit from an accredited college of medicine to enable a student to complete the requirements for a bachelor’s degree, provided that the following criteria are met:   The student is in good standing in the college of medicine;  The work taken in the college of medicine does not duplicate previous work;  The courses are in fields such as biochemistry, physiology, histology, or anatomy as approved by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences;  The student satisfies the enrollment residence requirement by completing at UIC at least the last 60 semester hours prior to entry into a college of medicine;  The student meets all other requirements for graduation from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, including a major field and a 2.00/4.00 cumulative GPA in all course work taken at UIC and other institutions.
