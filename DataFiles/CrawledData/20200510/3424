of rings. To what extent does the topological space alone determine the geometry of the variety?  In joint work with János Kollár, Max  
Lieblich, and Martin Olsson, we give a partial answer to this question  by showing that, under mild conditions on the variety, it is  
determined by its topological space together with its Picard group of  Weil divisors, and over uncountable algebraically closed fields of  
characteristic zero, the topological space determines the Picard  group, so one only needs the topological space. In this talk I will  
discuss the background for this problem, including a few cases where  the answer is easier, and then the main ideas of the proofs, which  
rely on modified versions of the classical fundamental theorem of  projective geometry.
