We know the spread of COVID-19 has led to a lot of changes in and outside of the University, and things can feel very uncertain and stressful – and you may have questions and need support. We are here for you.  The Dean of Students Office will remain open and all of our staff are available to assist you. However, for everyone’s safety and to help flatten the curve , we are going to change a few of the ways that we operate. Starting Friday, March 20th, our physical office in 3030 SSB will be closed until further notice. If you need to reach us, please do so by phone at 312-996-4857 or email at dos@uic.edu and we can set up a virtual meeting with you.  These changes will require some adjustments for us and for you, and we ask that you be patient as we adapt. If you reach out to us, know that we will get back to you as soon as we can.  Three key points:   Our Office is open! Our physical office may be closed, but we are still available to meet with you over the phone or internet. Please email or call to set up a time to talk.  Please be patient as we settle into this new way of working together.  Most importantly, we care about you and are here to help!   As always, remember that the U and I Care program is here for you as a resource should you require additional support during this time.  If you would like some additional information about how to keep yourself healthy and well during this time, our friends at the UIC Wellness Center have lots of tips and tools on their website.  Please do what you can to stay healthy, care for yourself and care for one another. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support.
