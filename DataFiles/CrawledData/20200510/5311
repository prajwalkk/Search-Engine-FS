(Fig. 1)    Tap the control panel touch screen until it lights up. The screen may periodically turn off when not touched for a while; you just need to tap it again. (Fig. 2)    Tap the “Turn Proj ON” button. The projector will turn on and begin a warm up countdown and the button will change to "Proj Warming Up." (Fig. 3)    While the projector is warming up, the control panel touch screen will lock and not respond to any button presses.  Once the warm-up cycle has completed, the panel will again respond to button presses.    You will hear beeps when you make successful contact with the icon buttons on the touch screen. If you don’t hear the beep, you aren’t tapping firmly enough.           Fig. 1       Fig. 2       Fig. 3          To use the built-in computer in this room  Instructions   Tap the “Built-in Computer” icon from the Source Menu. (Fig. 1)    The keyboard and mouse can be found either in the fold-down shelf, or the pull-out tray. (Fig. 2, 3)    Tap the spacebar or move/click the mouse to bring the computer out of hibernation.    The log in screen should appear on the computer monitor. Type in your NetID and common password.  If it is the first time you’ve signed into this machine, it will take a few moments to load.    To browse the Internet, click the “Internet Tools” icon on the desktop and use one of the browsers in the folder such as Firefox. (Fig. 4) (Fig. 5)    To connect a USB device, such as a flash drive or iClicker Receiver, connect to either the USB port that is on the top of the lectern near the microphone (available on most IML lecterns), or to a USB port on the front of the PC itself (located either below the keyboard/mouse tray, or in the left side drawer of the lectern).    When you are done, remember to double-click on the log out icon on the desktop, but do not turn the computer off. (Fig. 6)           Fig. 1       Fig. 2       Fig. 3       Fig. 4         Fig. 5       Fig. 6          To use a laptop in this room  Instructions   Set your laptop on the shelf on the right side of the lectern.  The shelf either slides out, or folds up and locks. (Fig. 1, 2)    Connect your device using the VGA cable and the audio plug (if you are using audio). The audio plug connects to the headphone jack on your device.  These cables should be found on the right side of the lectern resting on the shelf. (Fig. 2) Some devices may need an adapter – this is your responsibility to bring with you.    With some devices, you may need to enter a command to show the video image to the projector.  This command varies from device to device.  Windows-based laptops usally respond to “Windows key + P” and toggling through the display options.    Some devices may need to have the resolution adjusted.  Try either 1280 x 800 or 1024 x 768.    Tap the “Notebook Computer” icon on the touch screen. (Fig. 4)  In some locations, this button may instead say "External Input".  If so, press "External Input", and then "Laptop (VGA)".    To access the internet, you should connect wirelessly to the UIC-WiFi network.           Fig. 1       Fig. 2       Fig. 3          To use the document camera in this room  Instructions   The document camera will either be in the left or right side drawer of the lectern, or resting visibly on a shelf.    Power should turn on when the drawer is opened.  If not, from the control panel, press the “Doc Cam On/Off” button.    Pull the ring on the document camera up and let it pull away from you to raise the arm vertically.  (Fig.1)    Rotate the camera head so that it points at the document stage and the controls are facing you. (Fig. 2)    Controls can be done either at the control panel or at the document camera itself (Fig. 3).  The wheel control lets you zoom in and out on the document; the “MAN” buttons let you manually focus the camera, though the automatic focus may be sufficient.    The "Freeze" button on the camera will capture a still of whatever is on the stage at that point.  Just press the button to unfreeze.    To put the document camera away, turn it off and rotate the camera head back. Pull the ring straight towards you. This should make the camera bend back into the folded position. Close the camera drawer if applicable. (Fig. 4)           Fig. 1       Fig. 2       Fig. 3       Fig. 4          To use the DVD/VHS Player in this room  Instructions   Press the “VCR Player” or “DVD Player” button on the touch screen. (Fig. 1)    Press the “VCR/DVD On/Off” icon on the touch screen to turn the player on. (Fig. 2, 3)    The playback controls for the DVD/VCR will appear on the touch screen. (Fig. 2, 3)  Controls can also be used at the player itself.    Load the VHS tape or DVD disc into the DVD/VHS player, located below the keyboard. (Fig. 4)    When you are finished with the VHS/DVD, please remove it from the combo deck, then tap the “VCR/DVD On/Off” icon on the touch screen to turn the combo deck off. (Fig. 2, 3)           Fig. 1       Fig. 2       Fig. 3       Fig. 4          To use an auxiliary source in this room  Instructions   You can present from a audio/video auxiliary device such as a camcorder, multiregion DVD player or a VHS player; any devices with RCA connections (red, white, and yellow) should function.    Connect the device with RCA cables. These will either be coming out of the drawers on either side of the lectern or they will be wrapped up around hooks inside the cabinet in the lower right of the lectern. (Fig. 1)  If there are no cables in your room, please contact the LETS office.    Make sure that your device is on and then select the "Auxiliary Input" option on the touch screen menu. (Fig. 2)    Controlling will be done through your device.           Fig. 1       Fig. 2          To use the annotation feature in this room  Instructions   The lectern monitor can be drawn on, or annotated, digitally. Try it by dragging the fleshy part of your fingertip over the podium monitor (not a nail). This is a good way to highlight certain spots of text or to show mathematical equations. (Fig. 1)    Please note - the annotation feature is NOT a control mechanism, so you cannot select choices on a DVD menu or links in a browser window.    The corners of the monitor screen are hot spots that you can press to change the annotation color, undo the previous action, or clear the screen. These spots differ from podium to podium, but will be labeled on your particular monitor. (Fig. 2)           Fig. 1       Fig. 2          To use the lectern microphone in this room  Instructions   The microphone is located on the left side of the top of the lectern. (Fig. 1)    The light grey oval button at the base will turn on the microphone. The light will glow green when the microphone is on.  You can also tap the microphone head lightly with your hand in order to ensure it is on.    Volume is adjusted on the touch screen. Select "Volume Controls" in the lower left (Fig. 2) and then press the controls labeled “Lectern Mic” to adjust, or “Audio Level Reset” to reset all audio levels. (Fig. 3 - pending)    You must stay within short range of the lectern mic for it to pick up your voice.           Fig. 1       Fig. 2          To use a wireless microphone in this room  Instructions   Depending on which room you are in, a wireless microphone will either be found in a side drawer of the lectern along with batteries, or they are kept at the LETS office to be available for faculty using the classroom. (Fig. 1)    Please stop in at the LETS office in Lecture Center E room E112 to check out the microphone for your class, no reservation is needed, just have your iCard with you.    To use the wireless microphone in the room, turn it on with the little toggle switch at the top of the body pack (Fig. 2) and it will sync with the podium. The bodypack can clip to your pants or be placed in a pocket, and the microphone head clips to your collar.    You must then return the headset promptly after your class so that others may check it out for their classes.           Fig. 1       Fig. 2          To control volume in this room  Instructions   The volume for the computer, DVD/VHS Player, and any auxiliary source is controlled on the touch screen by pressing the Volume Control button (Fig. 1) and pressing the up/down arrows labeled "Program Audio". (Fig. 2)  (Additionally, volume for the PC can also be controlled via the desktop)    The volume for the microphones, if there are any, is controlled in the same way, but pressing the arrows labeled either Lectern Mic or Wireless Mic.    The lectern monitor may show a graphic feedback of the source volume level in its upper right corner.    Be aware that changing between sources may also adjust the volume levels.  This functionality helps avoid audio issues.    To mute the sound, press the "Mute" button in the middle of the volume arrows. (Fig. 2)  When the system is muted, this button will be red and say "Unmute."           Fig. 1       Fig. 2          To show/hide the projected image in this room  Instructions   Tap the “Class View” icon on the touch screen. (Fig. 1)  The button should become red and read “Inst. View”. (Fig. 2)    Instructor view mutes the projected image temporarily, but the source is still visible on the lectern monitor.    Be aware, however, that being in instructor view mode and then switching to another input generally makes the image show up on the projector unexpectedly.    To return to class view and show the projector image, tap the “Inst. View” button.           Fig. 1       Fig. 2          To finish in this room  Instructions   Always make sure to turn off the projector from the touch screen by tapping “Turn Proj Off.” (Fig. 1)    The projector will turn off and go through a cool down cycle lasting several minutes. While the projector is cooling down, the control panel touch screen will lock and not respond to any button presses. (Fig. 2) Once the cool down cycle has completed, the panel will again respond to button presses.    Make sure that you double-click on the 'Log off' icon on the computer if you’ve signed into it at any point. (Fig. 3) You should never turn the computer off.    Make sure to take any videos out of the DVD/VCR player and remove any other devices, such as USB drives or iClicker accessories.
