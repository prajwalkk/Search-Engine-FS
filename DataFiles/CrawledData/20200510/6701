ISACorps members focus their efforts on working with students who are low income and those whose families have no prior college-going experience. As a way to equitably serve the entire state, each ISACorps member is assigned to a community college district in Illinois, although they are not affiliated with the community college system. ISACorps members have a goal to spend approximately half of their time working in the highest need high schools in their district and half of their time in community-based organizations and locations. In order to better connect with students, every effort is made to recruit ISACorps members who are first generation college students and who come from, or went to school in the Illinois community to which they will be assigned. Affect the lives of youth and their families. Impact educational achievement levels of your community.
