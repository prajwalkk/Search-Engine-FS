LinkedIn alumni group   This is UIC Engineering’s official private alumni group on LinkedIn. Follow the link below and request to join the group. We screen requests to make sure that all members have attended the College, creating a true sense of community online.  The alumni group is a great place to post job opportunities, find former classmates, share news, learn about upcoming events that are open exclusively to alumni, and post about current issues in engineering or your particular industry.  Please join us!        LinkedIn public page   The college’s public page on LinkedIn is designed primarily for people who are new to UIC—for example, prospective students and faculty—but alumni may enjoy the news feed that is located on this page below the “About us” box.  Please “follow” this page (you should see a blue button in the left-hand column) so that our updates show up in your LinkedIn news feed. Alternatively, bookmark it and visit whenever you like. This also is a great page to suggest to your professional contacts who may be interested in serving as a partner to UIC Engineering.
