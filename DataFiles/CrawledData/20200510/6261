Celebrating and Sharing Research Achievement in Oral Sciences       Thank you for attending the 33rd Annual Clinic and Research Day on March 5,  2020!  >> Save the Date for the C&R Day 2021 - Coming soon!  Get the latest updates in oral health sciences at the 34th annual Clinic and Research Day! The College of Dentistry's annual Clinic and Research Day provides a forum for students, postgraduates, and research staff to present research achievements to the members of the College and larger research community. Additionally, Clinic and Research Day offers continuing education credit opportunities, dental products and service exhibits , a keynote lecture and student awards .  Join faculty, postgraduates, and students as they present a wide range of research activities from basic research, public health and prevention, and the development of best practices in dentistry, to the creation of techniques and technology that will allow teeth to be regenerated in adults. Research at the College spans from “bench to chairside” to advance diagnostic and interventional knowledge and therapies in oral health and other fields.  Continuing Education credit will be available for attending the poster presentations and the keynote presentation.  Support and learn from our students, residents, and fellows as they present a wide variety of posters highlighting current research covering basic, behavioral, clinical, and applied sciences applicable in public health and prevention, the development of best practices in dentistry, and the creation of techniques and technology that will allow teeth to be regenerated in adults. Research occurs at the College from the “bench to the chairside” (and the reverse)—to accelerate diagnostic and interventional therapies for College patients. Clinic and Research Day allows the postgraduates, students, and their faculty mentors to share their research with the dental and medical communities.  Driving life-changing discoveries through research is one of the goals of the College’s IGNITE: The Campaign for UIC , its $37 million fundraising campaign.  Over 130 posters covering several topics:  Cancer Biology/Oral Cancer  Biomaterials/Dental Materials  Tooth Development & Movement  Social Science/Behavior  Wound Healing/Tissue Regeneration & Repair  Imaging &Therapeutic Modalities  Case Reports & Literature Reviews  Tours and Exhibits  Vendor exhibits will be located on the 5th floor throughout the day.
