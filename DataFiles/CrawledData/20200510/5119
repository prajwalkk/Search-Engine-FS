The process is in place to ensure that policies with a broad university application have a consistent format, are formally reviewed, approved by the chancellor, widely communicated, centrally maintained, and readily available for review. Any questions regarding the process should be directed to policies@uic.edu .  The exception to this requirement is educational policy, as described in the University of Illinois Statues , which follows a different process ( II.1.b-e).  UIC policies and procedures should conform to applicable federal and state laws and regulations, and to the University of Illinois system Statutes, General Rules, policies, and procedures.  Policy Development Procedure  Step 1. With the approval of the vice chancellor/associate chancellor, or designate, responsible unit completes an internal review, including the recommended Policy Needs Assessment form.  Step 2 . Notify Committee on Policy that you have a policy in development via policies@uic.edu .  Step 3. Draft your policy (using the Policy Template ) with input from relevant stakeholders and senior leadership (or designate) in unit/s affected.  Step 4. Forward draft of policy to Committee on Policy for review. Committee on Policy may request revisions or other changes prior to taking a formal vote.  Step 5. After approval by Committee on Policy, committee sends to CVC/chancellor for final approval.  Step 6. Once the Committee on Policy and the chancellor approve the policy, the committee publishes policy on website and responsible unit notifies appropriate stakeholders using the policy communication tools.  Exceptions to Policy Development Procedure  Expedited Review  An expedited review may occur for any of the following reasons:   Non-substantive revisions (such as changing an office name or contact information, or reformatting an existing policy)  Legislative, Board of Trustees, or regulatory mandates requiring immediate action  Repeal of an existing policy   New and repealed polices that go through the expedited review process must be approved by the COP, CVC, and the chancellor (as described in the steps outlined above).  Interim Policies  The chancellor may issue or authorize interim policies in situations where there is insufficient time to complete the full policy development and approval process before an external mandate becomes effective.  An interim policy may remain in effect up to six months from the date of issuance.  Proposal from Someone Other than a Vice Chancellor/Associate Chancellor  A VC/AC is not the exclusive initiator of a new policy. Anyone on campus who determines a need for a new policy or a reason to revise an existing policy may propose a policy action.  Policies Requiring University Approval  In some cases, approval beyond the chancellor’s office may be necessary and will be determined on a case-by-case basis.  Existing University Policy   For information on adding existing university policies to this website, please contact policies@uic.edu .  Substantive revisions to existing UIC university policies should be made using the Policy Development Procedure.  Definitions  The following definitions describe the groups, office holders, key terms, and documents referenced in the policy development process and accompanying flow diagram.  University Policy : a statement that governs decision-making and conduct at UIC. University policy must meet all of the following criteria:   Have broad application across campus, i.e., affect more than one major college or administrative unit, including the University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System.  Advance compliance with applicable laws and regulations, promote operational efficiencies, enhance the university's mission, or reduce institutional risks  Mandate action or restraint with procedures for compliance.   An Official University Policy is a University Policy that has been approved through the policy development process detailed below. Specifically:   An Official University Policy has been through the established policy development process and formally approved by the chancellor following approval and submission by the UIC Committee on Policy (COP).  It meets the above criteria for a University Policy and conforms to the prescribed format of the UIC Policy Template.  There is a designated “current and active” status applied to the policy, including an established review period to ensure the policy remains current and appropriate.  All official University policies must be housed and maintained in the centralized policy repository and maintained by the Office of the Provost.   Once the policy has been through the complete process and is formally announced to the campus community, it is considered official.  Policies vs. Procedures : A policy must meet the criteria noted in the definition above. A procedure is a statement that outlines, often in a step-by-step fashion, how a policy will be implemented and by whom. The Committee on Policy approves policies, but not procedures. Procedures are developed by the unit that owns the policy. This allows the unit to update its procedures on a regular basis without having to return to the Committee for approval.  UIC Committee on Policy (COP) : a committee with the requisite policy expertise and stakeholder representation in areas relevant to University-level non-educational policy development and implementation appointed by the provost and/or chancellor. The COP is responsible for review of the initial proposal and approval of the policy draft, which is then submitted to the CVC for review and approval before it is sent to the chancellor for a decision.
