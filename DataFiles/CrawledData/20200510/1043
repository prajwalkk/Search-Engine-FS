The 10-story building provides residential accommodations for approximately 550 students in a traditional and semi-suite style environment.  Within the residential component, approximately 16,000 square feet features a fitness center, multiple social and/or gaming lounges, study lounges on each floor, laundry facilities, offices, and a tenth-floor sky lounge. The Academic & Residential Complex is LEED Gold certified by the US Green Building Council.  In addition to the residential components, the more than 50,000 square feet of academic space, includes three large lecture halls featuring “turn to team” design elements and four classrooms that enable team based learning. There are also several small group study rooms and open collaboration or individual work spaces, a tutoring center, along with computer stations, printers, and an IT helpdesk. The retail space is occupied by Starbucks.  This project is entirely financed by a private partner, American Campus Communities, in the first P3 partnership of its kind in the state of Illinois.
