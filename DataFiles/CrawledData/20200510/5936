ABOUT THE DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP HUB  The Digital Scholarship Hub aims to develop a greater digital scholarship presence on the UIC campus to help bring the scholarly work of faculty and students in all disciplines up-to-date and to pave the way for future projects.  Visitors to the Hub can meet with librarians and the Digital Humanities Initiative’s Postdoctoral Research Associate in Digital Humanities Hannah Huber, Ph.D., as well as other experts for help with digital humanities, digital scholarship, scholarly publishing, geographic information system (GIS) and other projects. Equipment available includes GIS data visualization displays, 3D printers, a laser cutter, computers with software for data and text mining and more.  ABOUT THE DIGITAL HUMANITIES INITIATIVE  The Digital Humanities Initiative is a collaboration between the UIC University Library and the Institute for the Humanities to provide technical support to allow UIC faculty to develop new methods and technologies in their current research, to create new paradigms in future scholarship and to increase graduate students’ exposure to digital techniques to enhance competitiveness in the job market. The Digital Humanities Initiative is generously supported by the University of Illinois System Presidential Initiative to Celebrate the Impact of the Arts and Humanities.
