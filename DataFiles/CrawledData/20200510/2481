UIC Language StorieS           Elizabeth  Wednesday, April 22, 2020  When I noticed that being bilingual gave me the opportunity to help others, I decided to minor in Spanish at UIC.             Dylan  Thursday, April 9, 2020  I am so grateful I am able to have all these memories all because I continued to take Spanish in my education career.  I definitely will be able to use Spanish as an elementary educator.             Andrea  Tuesday, March 17, 2020  "I love the Spanish language not only because it was my first language but because I sort of fell in love with it all over again."             Kei  Wednesday, March 4, 2020  I am rather insistent that my children have the same opportunities I did to become bilingual and bicultural. So one of my priorities is to ensure that they can speak Japanese fluently to ensure that they can explore both American and Japanese culture             Ranya  Friday, February 28, 2020  Knowing Spanish and Arabic has allowed me to translate customer needs at work, help people express their concerns when they need a translator, and has opened many opportunities for me to make bonds with people and engage in conversations.             Miroslava  Monday, February 24, 2020  My children are multi cultural and understand French and Bulgarian. One of my children studies Spanish in middle school. Languages are so important for our brain development and for our viewpoint on the world.             Lily  Thursday, February 20, 2020  My favorite word in German is “Vergangenheitsbewältigung”: overcoming of the past. I reflect on that word a lot as I proceed through my German coursework.             Marcia  Wednesday, February 19, 2020  With all these clues to an ethnolinguistic past, why didn’t we know we were German American? The answer lies in U.S. History, specifically in World War I.             Natz  Tuesday, February 18, 2020  Through learning French I have pushed myself out of my comfort zone and learned to communicate with others in a language that was not my native tongue.             Alma  Friday, February 14, 2020  I love my accent, wherever my accent comes from, it may just be a melting pot of an accent as far as I’m concerned!             Irma  Tuesday, February 11, 2020  Because of my experiences as a child, and my love for my own language and culture, I became a high school Spanish teacher.             Rebecca  Monday, February 10, 2020  There was an appeal to speaking other languages–they were the keys to new ideas, cultures, and understanding. I then set on a quest to learn as much about/as many languages as I could.             Tabitha  Tuesday, February 4, 2020  Ever since I can remember, I have always helped my parents when they need help in translating and vice versa.             Sarah  Friday, January 31, 2020  I decided that working in a French educational setting would be the best way for me to use my skills in the language while inspiring other young people to adopt a passion for French like me.             Oksana  Tuesday, January 14, 2020  Not only did we learn to speak Italian, but also became interested in and respectful of other cultures and languages. Professor Iusco inspired us to travel to widen our outlook and acquire new communication skills.             Nuria  Monday, January 13, 2020  When I was a baby, my mother taught me the Arabic, English, and Urdu alphabets and primarily spoke to me in Urdu.             Brian  Tuesday, December 10, 2019  I was organically acquiring bits and pieces of Russian, Polish, and Serbian through song lyrics, but had not yet had any opportunity to learn in a controlled setting.             Kevin  Thursday, December 5, 2019  What inspired me to take Italian is strangely enough my exposure to Italian culture and language through a video game called Assassin’s Creed 2 that takes place in cities such as Florence and Venice during the Renaissance.             Alicia  Tuesday, November 26, 2019  I worked in a sales role at a retail store where I found myself constantly communicating with local Spanish speakers, I could hold basic conversations, but I wanted to learn faster and I knew the only way to do that was to go live abroad.             Caleb  Thursday, November 21, 2019  My Mandarin has opened up many opportunities my life and led me to a plethora of wonderful experiences, including teaching Mandarin to students at my high school and surrounding schools.             Savannah  Wednesday, November 20, 2019  I am grateful for my language skills, and proud of my career as an educator. I have had several students pursue their own careers using French and Spanish, and I always love to hear their stories too!
