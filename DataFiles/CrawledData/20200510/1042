That was the toughest political decision. But it was the best thing.  Richard M. Daley, son of Richard J. Daley, interview excerpt, March 11, 2009   Mayor Richard J.

Construction entailed demolition of residential housing and most buildings of the historic Hull-House settlement.  The “301st day” of construction of the new University of Illinois at Chicago campus, July 30, 1964. 086 UA90_999_0359   He always talked about it. And then, when it came to fruition, with the protestors, it was very controversial, with the march around the house, and all that they said about my dad. It was hard. But he knew in his heart that that was good, because he loved education so much. He went to night school. He didn’t have it easy. In those days, that’s what they did. And they worked very hard.  Mary Carol Vanecko, daughter of Richard J. Daley, March 5, 2009       The University of Illinois at Chicago campus under construction, ca. 1965. 086 UA90_999_0357.2   He’d drive past when it was first under construction. I think it was based on his experience, how long it took to get his college degree, how long it took to get his law degree, and the expense of it. He was fortunate. He was an only child. His father worked. I think he saw the hardships that it brought on a lot of other students. He felt that the city and the state should put a major campus here in the city. And it had to be located somewhere where there was the best sources of public transportation. That was always his issue. Building it in the boondocks, where you had to have a car, would exclude so many kids. It had to have good access to public transportation.  Michael Daley, son of Richard J. Daley, interview excerpt, July 21, 2006                  5 of 7    A Chicago alderman comments on the “political courage” behind Mayor Daley’s decision to build the University of Illinois at Chicago in the city’s Near West Side.

And the university is well on its way to do that.  William Daley, son of Richard J. Daley, interview excerpt, December 5, 2008    Daley felt that it would enable people to more conveniently get that higher education and that they wouldn’t have to travel. And I’m sure that was one of the principal motivators.  George Dunne, Cook County Board President (1969-1991), interview except, December 16, 2003   UIC students walk to and from class, undated.
