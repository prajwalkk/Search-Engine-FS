PCOL 331.  Pharmacology for Dentistry.  4 hours.  Principles of pharmacology with emphasis on drugs for preoperative medication and pain management. Pharmacodynamics, nomenclature, and therapeutics. Course Information: Prerequisite(s): Human physiology and introductory biochemistry.    PCOL 399.  Undergraduate Laboratory Research.  1-4 hours.  Laboratory research for advanced undergraduates. Course Information: Animals used in instruction. Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grading only. May be repeated. Application of credit toward the degree is contingent upon the approval of the student's college and/or department. Prerequisite(s): Junior standing or above and consent of the instructor.    PCOL 430.  Principles of Toxicology.  2 hours.  Examines the toxic effects of drugs and chemicals on organ systems. Lectures emphasize basic principles, effects on specific organ systems, major classes of toxic chemicals, and specialized topics such as forensic and industrial toxicology.  Course Information:  Same as BPS 430 .  Credit is not given for PCOL 430 if the student has credit for EOHS 457.    PCOL 510.  Molecular Pharmacology of Platelets, Thrombosis and Vascular System.  2 hours.  Molecular mechanism and therapeutic approaches to: platelet functions, thrombosis, hemostasis, and vascular biology. The platelet as a model cell for molecular mechanisms of intracellular signal transduction and cell adhesion.  Course Information: Prerequisite(s): Credit or concurrent registration in GCLS 501 and GCLS 503; or consent of the instructor.    PCOL 530.  Pharmacology and Biology of the Vessel Wall.  2 hours.
