The wide range of health professions education programs across all UIC campuses—which is unique in the Midwest region and rare across the country—and the diversity of populations served by UI Health presents an unusually rich environment for interprofessional practice and education. UIC places a priority on health care disparities and population health in both training and research.  The overarching educational purpose in establishing a full IPE curriculum is to produce graduates who understand the critical relationship between teamwork and collaborative, patient-centered care, and who will contribute to the achievement of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s Quadruple Aim: improving the patient experience of care, improving the health of populations, improving provider well-being, and reducing the per capita cost of health care.       TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS     Strategic Plan Report and Appendices         Strategic Plan Report    Strategic Plan Report  Report Appendices         Task Force Recommendations         Task Force Recommendations   The Task Force recommends the following actions to create a successful organizational structure for IPE at UIC:   Establish a central home for IPE with appropriate financial resources.  Create a UIC campus-level position to provide leadership for the IPE program across the UIC campuses to implement the strategic plan, along with regionally distributed shared leadership and appropriate infrastructure at each UIC campus.  Formally recognize the Collaborative for Excellence in Interprofessional Education (CEIPE) as the Steering Committee for IPE across UIC campuses.  Establish a subcommittee of CEIPE (with additional members as needed) to focus on the development of collaborative practice at UI Health and other clinical partners.  Establish an Advisory Board that includes faculty, community agencies and other partners, patients and families, clinicians, students, and representatives of key UIC units from all campuses.
