Some of these organizations serve as professional-development groups for students in certain majors or with particular interests, while other organizations build community among future Black engineers, Hispanic engineers, women, or veterans in engineering.  UIC Engineering students are encouraged to join as many student organizations as they like—and to take on leadership roles whenever possible. A student activities fair each fall provides an opportunity for students to talk to members of each of these organizations and make decisions on which ones to join.      orgs        AAAEA  Arab American Association of Engineers and Architects          ACM  Association for Computing Machinery          AES  Audio Engineering Society          AIAA  American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics          AIChE  American Institute of Chemical Engineers          ASCE  American Society of Civil Engineers          ASHRAE  American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers          ASME  American Society of Mechanical Engineers          BMES  BioMedical Engineering Society          CMAA  Construction Management Association of America          ECS  Electrochemical Society          EDT  Engineering Design Team          EMBS  Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society          EWB  Engineers Without Borders          EWH  Engineering World Health          Greengineers  Engineering to preserve the planet          IEEE  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers          IISE  Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers          ITE  Institute of Transportation Engineers          LOGiCA  Latinx Organization for Growth in Computing and Academics          LUG  Linux Users Group          NSBE  National Society of Black Engineers          SAE  Society of Automotive Engineers (UIC Motorsports)          SASE  Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers          SHPE  Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers          SWE  Society of Women Engineers          VESE  Vehicle Electronics and Systems Engineering          WiCS  Women in Computer Science          AΗMβ  Alpha Eta Mu Beta honor society          ΗKN  Eta Kappa Nu honor society          πTΣ  Pi Tau Sigma honor society          Tβπ  Tau Beta Pi honor society           Additional Student Organizations   Websites for these organizations are coming soon:   Renewable Energy Team  Society of Manufacturing Engineers  Structural Engineers Association of Illinois  Veterans in Engineering           Undergraduate    Back to main content           Admitted Student Information    Admissions    Advising    Career Outcomes    Diversity    Engineering Expo    FAQ    Majors and Minors    Paid Internships    Scholarships    Student Groups    Student Resources    Women in Engineering                   UIC Logo         College of  Engineering            Contact   College of Engineering  851 S.
