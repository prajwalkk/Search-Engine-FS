Though we are not physically present in our offices at this time, we want you to know that we remain dedicated to supporting students’ mental health and well-being, more now than ever. We have worked hard to create remote access to our services and remain available to both new and existing clients. We are using Webex and phone formats for initial consultations and individual counseling sessions and are working to bring some of our groups and workshops to online formats as well.  In addition to this modification of our existing services, we are reaching out to the university community during these challenging times through other new and accessible ways. One of these efforts is represented by this newsletter, within which we eagerly share information, support and resources, in addition to updates found on our website. We are hopeful that the materials shared here will help generate ideas for sustaining well-being and also facilitate feelings of connectedness on and off campus.  Though the future remains uncertain, we continue to offer you the support of the Counseling Center, if even from afar.  Sincerely, Joseph Hermes, Ph.D.      E-Newsletters           May 7, 2020: Making Meaning             April 30, 2020: End-of-Semester Stress             April 23, 2020: The Unique Grief of COVID-19          E-Newsletters           April 16, 2020: Self-Care             April 9, 2020: The Cultural Impact of COVID-19             March 31, 2020: Coping with COVID-Related Stress          Modified on May 08, 2020                 UIC Logo        Counseling Center          Contact   UIC Counseling Center  1200 West Harrison Street, 2010 SSB, (MC 333), Chicago, Illinois 60607  Phone: (312) 996-3490  Fax: (312) 996-7645        Social Media Accounts             UIC.edu links   UIC.edu  Academic Calendar  Athletics  Campus Directory  Disability Resources  Emergency Information  Event Calendar  Job Openings  Library  Maps  UIC Safe Mobile App  UIC Today  UI Health  Veterans Affairs        Powered by Red 2.38.0  © 2020 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois |  Privacy Statement    Campuses   University of Illinois System  Urbana-Champaign  Springfield      Cookie Settings
