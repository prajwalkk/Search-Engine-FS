Researchers in nine colleges across campus will utilize the equipment, including Farzad Mashayek (pictured above; right), professor and head of mechanical and industrial engineering and SABER’s principal investigator, who uses HPC to study supersonic combustion in the Computational Multiphase Transport Laboratory ; Philip S. Yu, professor of computer science and Wexler Chair in Information Technology, who studies big-data mining in e-commerce, health care, social networks, and more in the Big Data and Social Computing Laboratory ; and Thomas Royston, professor and head of the Richard and Loan Hill Department of Bioengineering, who uses HPC to measure naturally-occurring sounds in the lungs and heart in the Acoustics and Vibrations Laboratory . The Electronic Visualization Laboratory will also use SABER to visualize results on its own systems and work with researchers to stream visualizations to their offices or labs.  Co-principal investigators from the College include Maxine Brown, director of the Software Technologies Research Center and the Electronic Visualization Laboratory; Ao Ma, associate professor of bioengineering; and Philip S. Yu, professor of computer science.  Read more about SABER here .
