Fiscal year 2016 data places UIC as one of the top five institutions for international students in the state of Illinois. Already a diverse campus that can proudly state that it has no racial or ethnic majority student enrollment, UIC continues to add to the global diversity of its students, faculty, and staff.  A total of 4,397 international students, representing 100 countries and territories, makes up the international student population at UIC for Fall 2016, an increase of 10.9% from Fall 2015 (3,966 students from 101 countries).  The international student population for Fall 2016 comprises 15.1% of the total number of enrolled students (29,120).  The 3,476 international graduate and professional students represent 34.5% of all students at this academic level.  A total of 768 international scholars, representing 76 countries and territories, makes up the international scholar population at UIC for Fall 2016.  The contributions of the international community are easily observed at UIC.  In addition to being a vibrant part of the diverse academic community, UIC’s international students contribute part of the $38.5 billion in economic activity generated by the 1,043,839 international students who studied at U.S. colleges and universities in 2015-16. In the state of Illinois, over 50,327 international students contributed nearly $1.6 billion dollars to the economy  and supported 22,270 total jobs (1,559 directly, 20,711 indirectly) in 2015-16.
