Policies approved through the policy development process   UIC has established a standardized policy development process for the development, approval, and oversight of non-academic, university-level policies. Educational policies are approved by the UIC Faculty Senate through a process described in the University of Illinois Statues .  Policies that are developed through the UIC policy development process are non-academic and have broad application across the university, i.e., affect more than one major college or administrative unit. The two additional criteria that define university-level policies are that they:   Advance compliance with applicable laws and regulations, promote operational efficiencies, enhance the university’s mission, or reduce institutional risks; and  Mandate action or restraint with procedures for compliance.
