Read more… →      The Campus Advocacy Network (CAN) is an on campus service center dedicated to providing confidential, anonymous, free services to UIC students, staff and faculty who have experienced sexual assault, domestic/dating violence, stalking and hate crimes. Our advocates are fully trained to state standards (40 hour sexual assault advocacy and 40 hour domestic violence advocacy) and have extensive training in stalking. They have many years of experience helping victims navigate systems they need to access on campus, including university administrative systems such as Title IX investigations and student conduct hearings, and off campus, including the criminal court system and the civil court system for obtaining Orders of Protection and No Contact Orders.  In addition to direct victim services we also offer education and training on these topics as well as programming about prevention education, bystander intervention, and men’s initiatives.  At CAN we believe that all people deserve safety from harm, but believe that this safety may be achieved in multiple ways. We respect that gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, class, religious beliefs, and ability can be factors that shape experience with violence.  Our office is open Monday through Friday from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm.
