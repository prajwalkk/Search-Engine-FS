Our sister agencies, partners, and affiliated programs help make sure that the work we do as a team has the greatest impact for our community.      Sister agencies   We’re home to the renowned Institute on Disability and Human Development , the University Center for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Education, Research and Service (UCEDD) for the State of Illinois.  We work collaboratively with our sister agencies, the Illinois Council on Developmental Disabilities and Equip for Equality, the State Protection and Advocacy Agency, to make up the Illinois Developmental Disabilities Network.           Illinois Council on Developmental Disabilities   Each state has a Developmental Disabilities Council that works to increase the independence, productivity, inclusion and integration of people with developmental disabilities. Councils provide training, educate and support communities, and inform policymakers.            Equip for Equality   Each state has a Protection and Advocacy (P&A) System to empower, protect, and advocate on behalf of persons with disabilities. P&As offer information and referral services for legal, administrative and other remedies to resolve problems for individuals and groups. P&As investigate reports of abuse and neglect, as well discrimination based on disability.
