If allegations arise against a registered student organization, the organization’s student leadership will be expected to represent the group throughout the community standards process. When appropriate for the situation, we will take steps to investigate the matter before issuing alleged violation(s), if any, against the registered student organization. If student health and safety is a concern during the investigation and resolution process, the Office of the Dean of Students may put interim measures into place during that time, including a provision the group cease & desist all activities until the process is complete or they are otherwise given permission to resume activity.    The Office of the Dean of Students collaborates with local and regional advisors, as well as national organizations, whenever possible. Occasionally, there may be times where our internal investigation may limit the amount of information we can share with those entities while the matter is being investigated. As soon as the office is able to share appropriate information with those entities, we will do so. If you, your advisor, or anyone else has any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at dos@uic.edu or 312-996-4857.
