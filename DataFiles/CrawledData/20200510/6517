Public health social work emphasizes prevention, not just intervention after a problem has developed, and it draws on multiple methods and systems to effect change including clinical interventions, education, research, advocacy, policy development, community organizing, and a range of other micro to macro interventions. Given these complementary approaches, it makes sense and adds value when the two degrees are pursued jointly with some shared course work.  The joint MSW/MPH degree allows students interested in the field of public health social work to complete the degree in a shorter period of time and provides students more opportunities to integrate the respective competencies and perspectives of the two disciplines in a deliberate and coordinated way.  Length of Program  Full time students may complete the programs in three to three and one-half years.       In the Words of an MSW/MPH Graduate        “As an MSW/MPH student at UIC, my academic training was grounded in equity, service and a commitment to working in the margins. I gained valuable skills necessary to examine the world as a complex interplay between the multiple levels of the social ecology, to understand the risk and protective factors for morbidity and mortality and to critically examine oppressive social and structural determinants of health and well-being.  I am proud and grateful for my time at UIC. My learning and experiences both in and outside the classroom enhanced and strengthened my commitment to a career centered on the reduction and prevention of youth violence.”  Emalee Pearson, MSW/MPH ’16  Read More About Emalee’s Experience »          Cost of Attending   Tuition and fees charged by the two programs differ. Students will be charged MSW tuition and fees for their first year of study and MPH tuition and fees for the second year. In year three, MSW tuition and fees will be applied again. If students must then complete remaining credit hours for the MPH program, the student will be charged MPH tuition and fees for their final semester of attendance. More information regarding tuition and fees is available at UIC Admissions .

To be considered for admission students must take the GRE (required for admission to SPH), have earned a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution, and satisfy other application requirements for each college.  Transferring into MSW/MPH joint degree program Students who enter either of the individual degree programs and later decide to transfer into the joint program may do so before entering their second year of study if they meet the admissions requirements of the other degree program. Students must apply and be accepted into both individual degree programs. Students entering from the SPH individual degree program will begin the Social Work core sequence immediately.  Students currently enrolled in the MSW program (full-time generalist year) may apply to the MPH degree by submitting the following documentation:   Scores of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) submitted directly to UIC SPH.
