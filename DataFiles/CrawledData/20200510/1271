You can configure MBAM Group Policy Templates that enable you to set BitLocker Drive Encryption policy options that are appropriate for your unit, and then use them to monitor client compliance with those policies. You can also report on the encryption status of an individual computer and on the unit as a whole. In addition, you can access recovery key information when users forget their PIN or password or when their BIOS or boot record changes.

More Info   Requirements   Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 8.1 Pro, Windows 8.1, or Windows 10 (Pro and Enterprise)  Two partitions  Trusted Platform Module (TPM) – (Not required for Windows 8.1 or 10 provided a PIN is set)   A TPM is a special chip that runs an authentication check on your hardware, software, and firmware. If the TPM detects an unauthorized change your PC will boot in a restricted mode to deter potential attackers.  NOTE: To determine if you have a TPM enabled, check the device manager and look for a Security Devices section. If you don’t see one listed, there might still be one on your system, but it might be disabled and need to be enabled in you computers BIOS.  NOTE: Please note that TPM 2.0 requires UEFI Secure Boot in order for BitLocker to work properly.
