DFI and Lincoln Fellows have access to additional mentoring, advice, and referral support from GC faculty and staff.&nbsp; Fellows can meet in a &quot;home a way from home&quot; setting to engage in various career development workshops, scholarly, and community-building events. Ms. Demetria Ward-Kato will serve as the contact person for both Lincoln and DFI fellows. The GC Assistant and Associate Deans and other staff will serve as mentors. In the near future, we will expand the mentoring network to include alumni recipients of the DFI and Lincoln Fellowships.  Activities and Services  The Fellows Mentoring Initiative has seven key components.   One-on-one meetings – GC Assistant and Associate Deans hold individal [1 hour] and walk-in appointments [15 min.] for Fellows to discuss academic, professional, and other related to success in their graduate programs.  Peer Mentoring – Junior graduate students are encouraged to connect with advanced graduate mentors. Alumni of DFI and UIC Lincoln Fellowships also serve as mentors to fellows.
