Art Resources in Teaching  Art Resources in Teaching was founded as the Chicago Public School Art Society in 1894 at Hull-House. It was led by Ellen Gates Starr and included a group of women from the Chicago Woman's Club. Its goal was to serve young people in the inner city. It did this initially by refurbishing classrooms and by providing art appreciation lectures and museum visits for schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods. The Chicago Public School Art Society has never been a part of or funded by the Chicago Public School System. To avoid confusion, its name was changed in 1984 to Art Resources in Teaching. The Society currently produces art appreciation curriculum materials, sponsors lectures, and awards scholarships to young art students.

National Congress of Parents and Teachers publications  This collection consists of bound material separated from the National Parent Teacher Association Records.

Some of the pages in the volumes contain annotations or marginalia by staff of the National Congress of Parents and Teachers.    National Congress of Parents and Teachers Records, 1896-1965  The National Congress of Parents and Teachers (now the PTA) was organized by Alice McLellan Birney and Phoebe Apperson Hearst in December 1896. The initial focus of the group was on mother/teacher cooperation and child welfare issues. However, as the organization grew and diversified, it supported many other causes including sex education, teacher salary increases, mothers' pension laws, safety, homemaking, adult education, nutrition, anti-drug and -tobacco use, race relations, and fluoridation.    National Parent Teacher Association Records  The National Parent Teacher Association can be traced back to the National Congress of Mothers, founded in 1897. The brief history available on the organization's web site states that "for more than a century, Parent Teacher Association (PTA) has provided support, information and resources to families focused on the health and education of children." This collection documents those efforts, with an emphasis on the period from 1950 to 2000.

Saint Mary's curriculum emphasized the practical and religious needs of young urban girls. Saint Mary's also tried to realistically serve the muti-ethnic communities of the west side in order to make secondary education more accessible to girls of working-class parents. In the late 1960s, the traditional formal structure of Saint Mary's High School was replaced by an alternative style learning environment where the students, teachers, and administration all shared in the processes of the school through teams.  It also began admitting male students in 1968. Some items restricted.
