Many students were excited by the idea of seeing their first NBA game, others were looking forward to seeing Michael Jordan's team in action, and some were looking forward to watching the face-off with the Nets, current home to the very popular and talented Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant. Though Irving and Durant were out on injury for this game (Durant is out for the season), the Nets still came to Chicago ready to play.  Students arrived at the United Center on the evening of Saturday, November 16th, and filed through the atrium where Michael Jordan's statue had been decorated with a Space Jam jersey to commemorate the 1996 film starring "His Airness" himself. The Bulls game theme was "90's Night" featuring entertainment like Spice Girls Karaoke and 90's hip-hop DJ's collaborating with the Jesse White Tumbling Team. The jumbo-tron and scoreboards were lit up in 90's color scheme; the time period is known for its bright and vibrant hues liken to tracksuits and video games.  The Bulls did not get off to a great start in the first quarter of the game, with the Nets opening up with a big lead of 11 points going into the second quarter, though the Bulls were able to fight back, outscoring and leading at the half. Bulls center Wendell Carter Jr. was working hard to grab 14 rebounds, nine of them offensive, and contributed 18 points in his efforts. Zach LaVine, the Bulls point guard, lead a scoring brigade for the team with 36 points, but unfortunately it wasn't enough to lift the team as they ultimately fell to the Nets 117-111.  Even though Chicago lost, the students enjoyed their NBA experience. The PIP office was happy to afford such an iconic Chicago event to the hard working students it supports. With the end of semester projects, assignments, and exams approaching, this game was a great opportunity for a study break and a moment to appreciate the city and culture.
