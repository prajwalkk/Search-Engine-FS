A more realistic point of view is that if all the costs of tuition and fees, housing, meals, and personal expenses for a semester at UIC are added up, there is not as wide a gap in cost as one might expect. There are also many very substantial scholarships available to Study Abroad students that are not accessible to students studying on campus.

Once you have selected a specific study abroad program, your SAO advisor will create a budget which can then be taken to the Financial Aid Office. Students should make an appointment with the Study Abroad Office contact in Financial Aid, Hua Kao , to discuss the financial aid package possible for the term abroad.    For exchange program students, aid will be disbursed directly into the student’s account and the university will charge tuition and fees as usual. All additional costs like housing, airfare, personal expenses, etc. are paid by the student directly. Non-exchange program students are not charged UIC tuition and fees. Aid will be disbursed to their account and they are responsible to use those funds to pay their program provider directly. Disbursal timing is based on the student completing all the necessary Financial Aid paperwork on time.   Things to remember about the cost of studying abroad   There are two exceptions to the UIC fees for all Study Abroad students:  Campus Care domestic insurance which will continue to be charged to your account unless you have already opted out of that plan. If applicable, you will need to enroll for international insurance if your study abroad program does not already include this in their program cost. Your Study Abroad advisor can confirm this for you.   There is a Study Abroad fee of $250 that will be charged to your account when the Study Abroad Office registers you for your term abroad.   Program costs will vary depending on the country and type of program. Program costs as posted by the program sponsor are not necessarily what you will pay. Talk to a Study Abroad advisor for program specific information.   Your Study Abroad advisor will review your program specific budget with you during an advising appointment. This budget is an estimate of all costs associated with your term abroad, including tuition, room and board, travel, insurance, personal expenses, etc. This budget is also the basis for review of eligibility for financial aid.        © Copyright 2014-2020 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois     Footer Navigation                    Vice Provost for Global Engagement  Office of External Scholarships  Office of Financial Aid  University Registrar  Centers for Diversity  Disability Resources  Privacy Policy  Contact Us     Translate »  Cookie Settings
