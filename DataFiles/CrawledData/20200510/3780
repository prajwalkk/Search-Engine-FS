Sponsored Programs consists of both a pre-award section – identifying funding opportunities, assisting in proposal development and submission, and negotiating the incoming award – and a post-award section responsible for managing awards from account setup through closeout.  The goal of Sponsored Programs at UIC is to support sponsored research by providing exceptional service, expertise, and education while maintaining a collaborative model of stewardship among all University faculty and staff.      lifecycle           Find Funding  Identify and assist with funding opportunities, including limited submissions             Develop Proposal  Proposal Development             Submit Proposal  Submit a proposal for review             Receive Award  Acceptance and setup of a funded project             Manage Award  Manage Award             Closeout Award  Closeout Award          Quick links        Sponsored Program Expenditure Reports          Single Audit Reports          Forms and Submission Links          Resources        Assurances          Education & Training          Policies and Guidance          OSPNews Subscription Request          Contact Us           Announcements and Events       Information for Campus Research Restart    Posted on April 28, 2020        CCTS Pilot Funding for COVID-19    Posted on April 14, 2020        Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research UPDATE – Friday, March 20, 2020 - 5:25pm    Posted on March 20, 2020        Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research UPDATE – March 19, 2020, 4:25pm    Posted on March 19, 2020        COVID-19 Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research Update - March 17, 2020    Posted on March 17, 2020                  Sponsored Programs    Back to main content           Find Funding     Limited Competitions     Limited Competitions Archive      Internal Funding    External Funding    Government Relations Liaisons: Lewis-Burke/GRC/EAB    RDS Newsletter    Faculty Awards     Research and Scholarship Annual Award Competition     Researcher, Scholar, and Inventor of the Year Awards Recipients    Submission Cover Page      Awards for Creative Activity in the Fine, Performing, and Applied Arts; the Humanities; and the Social Sciences     Recipients    Letter of Intent to Apply    Application Submission        Education and Training    Forms      Develop Proposal    Submit Proposal     How to Submit a Proposal for Review    How do I Build a Budget    How do I submit post submission actions    Electronic Portals and Access Requests    Proposal Resources      Receive Award     Types of Awards and Agreements    Anticipation Funds and Pre-Award Spending    Negotiating Terms and Conditions in Research Agreements    Best Practices – Receiving an Award    Best Practices – Agreement Review and Execution    Subrecipients      Manage Award     Best Practice – Managing an Award    Allowable Expenses    Billing & Payments    Budget Adjustments    Cost Transfers    Effort Reporting    Grant Transfers    Monitoring Expenditures    No Cost Extension    Non-Competing Progress Reports    Participant Support Costs    Prior Approval    Program Income    Subrecipient Monitoring      Closeout Award     Best Practices – Award Closeout    Financial Closeout    Programmatic Closeout    HHS Award Closeout      Forms and Templates    Policies and Guidance    Find Contacts     Agreement Negotiator Contacts    Proposal Submission Contacts    Post-Award Contacts by Topic      Contact Us                   UIC Logo         Office Of  The Vice  Chancellor  For  Research                   Contact   Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research  1737 West Polk Street, Suite 310, MC 672, Chicago, IL 60612  Phone: (312) 996-4995  Fax: (312 ) 996-9598  ovcrweb@uic.edu        Social Media Accounts             UIC.edu links   UIC.edu  Academic Calendar  Athletics  Campus Directory  Disability Resources  Emergency Information  Event Calendar  Job Openings  Library  Maps  UIC Safe Mobile App  UIC Today  UI Health  Veterans Affairs        Powered by Red 2.38.0  © 2020 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois |  Privacy Statement    Campuses   University of Illinois System  Urbana-Champaign  Springfield      Cookie Settings
