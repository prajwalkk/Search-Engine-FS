The transaction process is encrypted, so you can safely and securely support any of our departments or programs. You may either make a one-time gift or set up recurring payments online using your credit card.    Mail  Please make gifts by check payable to the University of Illinois Foundation, indicating the purpose or fund designation of your gift in the memo field.  Mail your check to:  Office of Advancement and Alumni Affairs (MC 621) UIC College of Dentistry 801 S. Paulina St. Chicago, IL 60612  For the security of your gift, please do not send cash.    Electronic Funds Transfer  EFT is a secure way to deliver your gifts directly and automatically from your bank to the University of Illinois Foundation for the benefit of the College of Dentistry. As with online giving, EFT donations allow us to minimize administrative expenses.  When you make an EFT gift, your bank disburses the funds automatically according to your instructions until you decide to stop. You may extend your contribution into installments over the entire year.  To make your gifts via EFT, simply download, complete and return the EFT Authorization Form to the University of Illinois Foundation.    Payroll Deduction  Payroll deduction is an easy way for University employees to make gifts directly and automatically from a paycheck. To make your gifts via payroll deduction, simply download, complete the Payroll Deduction Authorization Card and mail to:  Office of Advancement and Alumni Affairs (MC 621) UIC College of Dentistry 801 S. Paulina St. Chicago, IL 60612    Securities  To make a gift to the College of Dentistry of publicly traded stocks or mutual funds via electronic transfer, please contact the Foundation Cash Receipts Department for delivery instructions at cashdesk@uif.uillinois.edu or (217) 244-0352.  The Foundation does not publish the delivery instructions in an effort to insure proper identification of the donor transferring the gift; verify the name of the securities and appropriate number of shares to be received; and the designation of the gift prior to the transfer.      Types of Gifts    Current Use/Unrestricted  Unrestricted funds are a very powerful form of private support because they allow the University to use them as it sees fit, where current (and often time sensitive) needs are greatest.  Unrestricted funds may be used for many kinds of assistance, including:  Student support  Faculty support  Research aid  Books, collections, and supplies purchases  Technological upgrades  Endowments  Endowments make it possible for a gift to live on in perpetuity, preserving the principal and utilizing its earnings to support the intent of the fund. Endowments help fund faculty chairs and professorships, graduate fellowships, undergraduate scholarships, program support, visiting scholars/lectureships, research support, student internships, and more. An endowment can be created through an outright gift, through a bequest in a will, or through a life income gift such as a charitable gift annuity or a charitable remainder trust. Learn more about endowments on the University of Illinois Foundation website.   Planned Gifts   Charitable Gift Annuities  The University of Illinois Foundation's charitable gift annuity program enables alumni, faculty, and friends to support the College of Dentistry and create a reliable source of income that lasts a lifetime. Please contact us to learn more or to request a benefits estimate.                                 Contact    Need more information about ways to give?  Mark J.
