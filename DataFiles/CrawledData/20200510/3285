Riders must present a valid i-card to board.  One (1) guest is allowed per i-card holder, and will be required to present a state issued ID to be entered into TransLoc.  All riders must be entered into the TransLoc application to ride.  Night Ride will not transport riders beyond the posted boundaries.  Night Ride reserves the right to refuse service in situations that place drivers or patrons in danger. Examples may include drunk, belligerent or abusive passengers.  Alcohol is not permitted in the vehicle at any time.  Eating, drinking, and smoking are not permitted in the vehicle at any time.  Night Ride will only wait 5 minutes after arrival before declaring a no-show.  Three (3) no-shows in a 30 day period may result in a suspension of Night Ride privileges.  Night Ride will charge $200 if you vomit in a Night Ride vehicle to cover the cost of sanitizing the interior. Incidents taking place in Night Ride vehicles may be reported to the Office of the Dean of Students or respective Department Head of the involved parties. I-card holders will be held responsible for the conduct of their guests. Riders without proper ID will not be permitted to board.  No weapons of any kind will be permitted in the vehicle at any time.
