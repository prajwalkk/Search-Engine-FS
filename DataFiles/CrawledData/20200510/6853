And, as a token of our gratitude to Chicago, our partners and our pleasant posting we wanted to establish a legacy that would have a positive impact on the youth and in an area that we all agree that is of paramount importance, education. Awardees are students doing undergraduate, graduate and doctoral work.This is an important issue that is a core value to the CCC and to send the message to the foreign students, that we appreciate, admire and support their efforts and the sacrifice that it represents to them and their families to strive for a better education.
