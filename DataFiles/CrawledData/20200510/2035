Admission to every GPPA program is competitive , and there are a limited number of spaces available per year. Medicine, Pharmacy and Dentistry have traditionally been the most competitive programs.  The most successful GPPA applicants are those who know their future profession and want a guaranteed educational path to that profession. High school students with strong academic records, extracurricular activities, and leadership experiences are encouraged to apply.  Applicants for GPPA Medicine and Dentistry must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents AND Illinois residents  Applicants for GPPA Public Health must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents but are not required to reside in Illinois.  A holistic approach is used when reviewing each application because we feel that selecting students requires a careful and individualized review of each applicant’s credentials. Consideration is given to high school GPA and the strength of the high school schedule, ACT scores, and personal statements.  Letters of recommendation, extracurricular activities, or any other supporting documents are also strongly considered in the review process.  There is no minimum to apply; however the most successful candidates will have an ACT composite score of 28 or SAT score of 1310 or higher and rank in the top 15% of the high school class.
