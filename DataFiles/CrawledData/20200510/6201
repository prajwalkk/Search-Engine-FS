We aim to facilitate greater interaction among students with instructors and to introduce and encourage students to seek a career in dental education. Our chapter is unique in that we have a peer mentoring program, through which upperclassmen guide the students in the classes below with navigating the challenges of the UIC dental curriculum.    Dental Charity Ball Foundation    In 1996, the Dental Charity Ball began with a small group of dedicated volunteers. Over the years our numbers have grown and the annual Charity Ball has now become the definitive Chicago-area charitable dental event of the year. This celebration and charitable fundraiser helps support the dental needs of the under-served. It is run entirely by student volunteers. For the first time, University of Illinois at Chicago and Midwestern (Downer’s Grove campus) dental schools are joining forces to plan the event and raise funds for charitable causes. The proceeds from the ball support the Dental Charity Foundation, a registered 501(c)3 organization that promotes oral health education and charitable dental care with a focus on pediatric and student-led causes.  Despite our technological and medicinal advances, dental disease still remains rampant among the certain vulnerable populations. Chief among these populations are children, who if not properly instructed and supervised will often fall into the trap of life-long dental disease. Too often we find barriers to dental care and oral health education.  There is a desire to provide these much needed services but due to a lack of funds the volunteer efforts are either curtailed or never realized. The Dental Charity Foundation aims to help reduce these barriers by providing funding to organizations that provide oral health education and charitable dental care. Funds are raised through a silent auction, corporate and private donations. This funding translates into the ability to do more good for children and adults in underserved communities. We are grateful to all of our donors from previous years and look forward to continuing this philanthropic tradition for years to come.  Association of Muslim Dental Students (AMDS)   The Association of Muslim Dental Students is an organization serving Muslim dental students and anyone interested in learning about the Islamic faith and culture within the College of Dentistry at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

Christian Medical and Dental Association (CMDA)   The Christian Medical and Dental Association exists to glorify God by motivating, educating and equipping Christian healthcare professionals and students.

Throughout the year, CMDA offers students opportunities to serve the community as well as build relationships with students and faculty at the College of Dentistry through various community service events, social events, and weekly meetings. Our chapter at the UIC College of Dentistry holds weekly meetings during the lunch hour for Bible studies, food, and fellowship with one another. Everyone is invited and welcome!
