Led by the primary investigator at Indiana University-Indianapolis (IUPUI), the team consists of research collaborators at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, the University of Illinois at Chicago, Northwestern University, Oregon State University, Indiana University-Bloomington, and a site facilitator at Linn-Benton Community College. (Abigail Goben) (IMLS)  Research Data Management Best Practice Implementation for Graduate Students in STEM and Health Sciences The Research Data Management Best Practice Implementation project will increase graduate student knowledge of data management best practices, increase student understanding of how data management integrates into their research work, and determine if these practices are adopted long term. This pilot uses a flipped class room model to present the students with appropriate practices in an eight-week intensive program. (Tina Griffin) (NLM)  Community Health in the Library (CHIL): Reinvigorating Outreach at the UIC Crawford Library of the Health Sciences The Community Health in the Library (CHIL): Reinvigorating Outreach at the UIC Crawford Library of the Health Sciences project will improve access to high quality, reliable health information for the city of Rockford, Illinois and the surrounding Winnebago County community. (Cynthia Reynolds) (NLM)  Chicago Collections Consortium The UIC Library is a founding/governing member of the Chicago Collections Consortium, and UIC librarians serve on the board and on many of the committees to help preserve and share the history and culture of the Chicago region. Mary Case is on the board of directors, Kate Flynn is the Explore Portal Manager, and many UIC Library faculty serve on committees for the Chicago Collections Consortium.  DataOne DataONE is a federation of scientific repositories containing over one million datasets from more than forty science data repositories worldwide. The UIC Library operates a replication repository within the DataONE federation. Dr. Robert J. Sandusky is a member of the DataONE Leadership Team and is co-chair of the DataONE Users Group.  Digital Public Library of America (DPLA), Illinois Digital Heritage Hub (IDHH) As a member of the Illinois Digital Heritage Hub, the UIC Library’s digitized collections are available in the Digital Public Library of America, a resource for discovering digitized materials at libraries nationwide. Tracy Seneca is on the board of the IDHH.  Nursing Experts: Translating the Evidence (NExT) The NExT project, a collaboration between the UIC Library, the UIC College of Nursing and Western Illinois University School of Nursing, aims to improve community health with free education and resources for public health nurses and other community practitioners. NExT includes in-person workshops, an online course, and a mobile information portal ( gonext.uic.edu ), to learn and to support evidence-based practice. The project team has provided 12 in-person workshops throughout the state of Illinois and has awarded online CEUs throughout the United States.?This project was supported by the funding of two project awards from the?Greater Midwest Region of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine.  Open Textbook Faculty Incentive Program The high-cost of textbooks is one of the factors that affects student learning outcomes and student success. Students avoid certain classes, drop a class, or do poorly when they cannot afford the text for a course. The Open Textbook Faculty Incentive Program will be to support undergraduate students by creating incentives for teaching faculty to use alternative lower-cost educational materials rather than high-cost textbooks. This may include the creation of new Open Educational Resources (OER) or the use of existing OER materials.       How Do I...?
