In an international affiliation agreement, resources are committed by each institution to support academic programs, student and faculty exchanges, placement abroad, research collaboration, technical assistance, professional development and similar cooperative activities.  Throughout these guidelines, an International Affiliation Agreement is distinguished from a Grant for Research Agreement. The latter normally carries conditions set by the sponsor, and/or may require compliance with policies, norms, and regulations managed exclusively by OVCR. Additionally, within the exclusive purview of OVCR are Sponsored Projects. These are contracts or subcontracts as described in Section 16 – Grants and Research Contracts of the UI Policies and Procedures Manual.
