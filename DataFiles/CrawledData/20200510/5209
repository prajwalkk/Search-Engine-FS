But the focus of our organization is still helping children and young adults with special healthcare needs. By partnering with families, we assist them in finding appropriate services and providers, and also to become strong advocates for their children. It’s an amazing experience when a parent tells you how DSCC has helped their child become more than they ever thought possible."
