AHS financial aid info    Office of Student Financial Aid    Graduate student funding overview    ​Online test proctoring fees  Some courses in the programs offered in the Department of Biomedical and Health Information Sciences require proctored exams. As a convenience to students, the department offers an online proctoring service for a nominal fee.  Payment of this fee is the obligation of the individual examinees. Payment is made with a credit or debit card via a secure page connected to a third party card processor. Proctoring fees are based on the length of the exam and when it is scheduled. A typical 1-2 hr exam has a fee of $25.00. A part-time student (enrolled in two courses per semester) can expect to spend about $50 per semester, while a typical full-time student (enrolled in five courses) can expect to spend about $125 per semester. In addition, students pay the proctoring fee if they desire to take proficiency tests. Note that the exact amount paid for proctoring fees will vary by student over time.  Use of the proctoring service requires technology that is typical for online students. ProctorU has published minimum and recommended technical requirements .  Students have the option to secure an alternative proctor if acceptable to the instructor.   Library/IT fee  A library/IT fee will be assessed at the rate of $18 per credit hour and covers the following services: use of online Library and IT services such as Blackboard, UIC e-mail, software licenses, technology security, published works and periodicals through the Library database and others.
