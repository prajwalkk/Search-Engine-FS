Visit the Dissertation Process page for full details.          Additional PhD Policies and Procedures     Advisor         Advisor   All PhD students are assigned a temporary advisor upon admission. Students are encouraged to choose a permanent advisor by their second semester. By the completion of the third semester, a formal Permanent Advisor selection form must be submitted to the CS Student Affairs office. Permanent advisors must be chosen by mutual agreement.        PhD Assessment         PhD Assessment   All PhD students are required to complete the College of Engineering’s annual online self-assessment. Students are notified when the self-assessment is open and provided with the link. It requires demographic information, self-evaluation, publications, presentations, and plans for the upcoming year.  Once the student completes and submits the survey, the advisor receives a notification that allows him or her to verify and provide feedback on the student’s progress.        Transfers to the MS program         Transfers to the MS program   The UIC College of Engineering strategic plan states that students in a PhD program who have received any financial support from UIC—such as a teaching assistantship, research assistantship, fellowship, or tuition and fee waiver—cannot transfer into any MS program in the College of Engineering, which includes computer science, without an approved petition.
