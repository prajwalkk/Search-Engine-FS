Pictures  One of the ways in which we document our internship activities is through photography.            Satellite Gardens  Currently there are 8 satellite gardens on UIC's East campus.            Research  Garden interns research the cultural significance of the plants in the garden. Check out the plants we have at the garden as well as other interesting research projects.            Stories & Recipes  We collect stories from family, friends, and community members about environmentally friendly practices and heritage plants.            Public Programs  We engage students, faculty, staff, and community members on issues of environmental sustainability, cultural diversity, and social justice.            Creative Projects  We work with local artists to make creative and explicit expressions on environmental and cultural sustainability.            Seed Library  We collect seeds from our garden satellites, local gardeners, and gardens around the globe.            Shikaakwa  The satellite garden serves to recognize Indigenous land of the Chicago area and to the plants that have lived in the region for centuries, sustaining the human and non-human residents.            Monarch Butterfly Habitat  Garden interns have established a garden satellite for the conservation of monarch butterflies.            Contact Us  Have any questions or want to learn more?
