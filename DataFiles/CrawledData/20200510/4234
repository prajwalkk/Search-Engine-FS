Historically, Americans lived in small towns and rural settings; however, today the vast majority of Americans live within expanding urban regions that are linked to a global network of cities. The Urban Studies program educates students on the complexity and diversity of urban areas; teaches students comprehensive policy and tools for addressing urban problems and creating solutions; and provides students with the opportunity to experience hands-on learning through internships, applied research, access to top scholars and professionals in the field, unique international exchange opportunities, and by fostering leadership development. Graduates of Urban Studies will have mastered skills in:   Identifying complex interrelated forces that shape urban areas.  Employing relevant techniques and critical analysis to craft and evaluate potential solutions for addressing urban challenges.  Applying ethics and values related to the production of cities and to professional practice, including knowledge of collaboration, diversity, equity, sustainability, and democracy.  Using critical analytical skills to assess, produce, analyze, and present data.  Applying knowledge of planning practices, policy analysis, and implementation.  Exercising proficiency and effective use of visualization and communication tools.   Urban Studies graduates enter careers in public and nonprofit service, public finance, community development, or other city planning and development activities. Students entering graduate education will be prepared to study in related fields, such as public administration, urban planning, public health, law, public relations, international studies, sociology, political science, public health, or peace and social justice studies.  Admission Requirements  New freshmen or transfer students interested in admission to the Bachelor of Arts in Urban Studies must complete the standard application process to the university and be admitted by the Department of Urban Planning and Policy in the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs. Admission is competitive, and preference is given to those applicants selected to have the best potential for academic success.  Transfer students who have completed a minimum of 24 semester or 36 quarter hours of transferable college classroom credit by the time of application, and do not meet the definition of an incoming freshman or a readmission applicant may apply to transfer into the program. Applications should include a personal statement of educational goals. See the Admissions section for additional information. See the Office of Admission Transfer Guide for more information about transfer admission requirements.
