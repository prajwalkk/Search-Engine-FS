Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology   Exercise Science and Health Promotion  Movement Science   Bachelor of Science in Nutrition   Coordinated Program  Nutrition Science   BS in Kinesiology  The undergraduate program in kinesiology offers a common core in the foundations of kinesiology (human structure, function, and movement) and two major concentrations: 1) Exercise Science and Health Promotion and 2) Movement Science.  The Exercise Science and Health Promotion concentration prepares students for careers in fitness, health care, sport, workplace, and public health settings. Students develop the skills to design, deliver, and evaluate service programs for individuals, groups, and populations. Movement Science emphasizes basic science learning through a series of rigorous courses combined with the application of scientific principles. The program offers ideal preparation for graduate study or professional training in the life/health sciences.  Kinesiology courses are taught by nationally and globally recognized leaders in their areas of teaching, research, and service who emphasize translating science into practice through hands-on learning, independent study, and internship experiences.  Graduates of both concentrations move on to graduate or professional training and careers in areas such as medicine, health promotion, worksite wellness, research, occupational therapy, physical therapy, dentistry, pharmacy, personal training, health-related businesses, and other health-related opportunities.  Transfer Admission Requirements  Students seeking admission to the department as a transfer student must meet the entrance requirements that are specified for transfer students. The minimum transfer grade point average for admission is 2.50/4.00. No more than 60 semester hours (90 quarter hours) of credit may be accepted as transfer work from a two-year college. Complete transcripts from all postsecondary institutions must be submitted in order to be considered for admission. See the Office of Admission Transfer Guide for more information about transfer admission requirements.  BS in Nutrition  The Coordinated Program in Nutrition is an Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) accredited coordinated program. It combines the ACEND required didactic course work with the required supervised practice hours that prepare graduates to sit for the Registration Examination for Dietitians.  The Nutrition Science program, an accredited Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD), provides students with the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) required didactic course work. Upon completion of the Nutrition Science Program, students are eligible to apply for an accredited dietetic internship at another institution. After successfully completing a dietetic internship, students are eligible to sit for the Registration Examination for Dietitians. This program is also intended for students who do not wish to become registered dietitians, but instead plan to pursue advanced degrees in nutritional sciences, public health, allied health, or a professional degree in medicine.  Coordinated Program Concentration  Currently granted accreditation by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.  Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics 120 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 2000 Chicago, IL 60606-6995 Phone: (312) 899-0040, ext. 5400  http://www.eatright.org  The Coordinated Program requires students to complete six semesters of full-time study, which includes didactic classroom work in conjunction with over 1,200 hours of supervised practice experiences provided at a variety of locations throughout the Chicagoland area.  The Coordinated Program prepares graduates for entry-level positions as dietitians in a variety of employment settings, such as healthcare institutions, government organizations, business, industry, and community health agencies. With experience or advanced education, career opportunities can be found in research, education, or private practice. The employment outlook for dietitians is projected to grow in the twenty-first century.  Dietitians provide nutritional care to people in health and disease throughout the life cycle in accordance with their nutritional requirements and food habits. Dietitians’ activities include the provision of direct inpatient and outpatient services as well as community program planning and evaluation, clinical protocol development, food service management, and research. Therefore, a dietitian must be knowledgeable in the biological and physical sciences, psychology, sociology, education, and management and must have expertise in food habits, food composition, food service, science of food and nutrition, energy and nutrient needs, program development and evaluation, and research methods. Dietitians counsel clients, as well as work with other members of the healthcare team in providing nutritional care in the clinical setting, and work with consumers in wellness programs and community agencies. Management of personnel, budgets, food operations, and consumer-oriented services in the food or healthcare industry are other areas for dietitians.  Nutrition Science Concentration  The Nutrition Science concentration prepares students for a future career as a registered dietitian, as well as for graduate study in nutrition, medicine, public health, other allied health fields, and dentistry. It is currently granted initial accreditation by The Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics as a Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD).  Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics 120 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 2000 Chicago, IL 60606-6995 phone: (312) 899-0040, ext. 5400  http://www.eatright.org  The research and teaching is focused on the sciences of nutrition, physiology, biochemistry, and molecular biology and the application of knowledge in these disciplines to the maintenance of health and well-being of humans throughout their lives. The curriculum offers a wide range of courses on the nutritional, epidemiological, and behavioral aspects of human diseases, a broad perspective on human biology (including cultural factors), and a strong clinical orientation. Students who intend to become dietitians may choose to apply for an accredited dietetic internship outside of UIC to be completed post-graduation.  First Year Admission  New first year applicants interested in pursuing the Bachelor of Science in Nutrition are eligible to apply to the Nutrition Science program (concentration) through the Department of Kinesiology and Nutrition. Students must meet the general UIC entrance requirements. A high school curriculum that emphasizes math and the natural sciences (biology, anatomy and physiology, chemistry and physics) gives the student the best chance for success in nutrition. The program will accept UIC and non-UIC transfer students. Prerequisites for ACEND accredited program, such as DPD or CP, may complete their prerequisite at UIC as Nutrition Science majors.  Transfer Admission Requirements  Students seeking admission to the Bachelor of Science in Nutrition, Nutrition Sciences program (concentration) must meet the minimum GPA of 2.50/4.00; however, admission is not guaranteed and transfer requests will be considered on an individual basis.  Students seeking admission to the Bachelor of Science in Nutrition, Coordinated Program (concentration) must meet these minimum requirements:   65 semester or 97.5 quarter hours of acceptable academic credit  Minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.50/4.00 (However, currently the average GPA of students accepted into the Coordinated Program is 3.60/4.00, while the average GPA of students accepted into the Nutrition Science program is 3.40/4.00.)  Successful completion of the required prerequisite courses   The applicant’s personal characteristics, motivation, academic background, and work experiences are factors evaluated in selecting candidates for admission into the Coordinated Program through recommendations as well as written and face-to-face interviews.  See the Office of Admission Transfer Guide for more information about transfer admission requirements.
