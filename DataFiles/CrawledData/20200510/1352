Currently, most Library locations remain open in order to help meet the needs of our students and faculty who may need access to our facilities, materials and equipment in order to participate in and teach their classes remotely. However, our facilities are operating under reduced hours and greatly reduced staff . Please see the Hours page for each location on the Library’s website for further details.  Online Collections and Services  Even though facilities are open, we encourage you to access our many collections and services online. The Library subscribes to tens of thousands of online resources that can be searched through our Library website at library.uic.edu . Hundreds of research guides provide information about specific disciplinary resources as well as about issues such as copyright, which may be on your mind as you move your courses online.  Our virtual reference services are available through our Chat with a Librarian (located on the lower right corner of every page of the Library’s website), email or the Ask a Librarian service on our website. Library faculty are also available for virtual research consultations . Chat with a Librarian services will be available from Sun. to Thurs., 7:30 a.m. to 1 a.m.; Fri., 7:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.; and Sat., 7:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. All other inquiries submitted through email, Ask a Librarian or our website will be answered within 24 hours.

Daley Library and the Library of the Health Sciences – Chicago are closed . Librarians will be answering reference questions through Ask a Librarian and providing scans of materials when possible.  In our facilities we are taking additional cleaning measures, providing hand sanitizer and wipes, and reminding staff and users to practice social distancing and good hygiene. Please do your part to help us maintain as clean an environment as possible by wiping down tables, keyboards and other surfaces as appropriate (please do not wipe down library materials) with the wipes provided and wash your hands before and after use.  I-Share and Interlibrary Loan  Interlibrary loan for article requests is still is available, however turnaround time for receiving materials is expected to be slower than usual.
