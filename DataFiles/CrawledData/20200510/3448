Yu Cheng  Yu Cheng  Home  Research  Misc      I am an Assistant Professor in the Mathematics (MSCS) Department at the University of Illinois at Chicago , where I am part of the Mathematical Computer Science (MCS) group. I have a courtesy appointment in Computer Science and I am a member of the Theoretical Computer Science (TCS) community at UIC.  I did my PhD in the CS Theory group at the University of Southern California , advised by Shang-Hua Teng .
				I was a postdoc in the Theory and CS-Econ groups at Duke University .      Research : My main research interests lie in the area of machine learning, game theory, and optimization.
				Recently, my work focuses on designing scalable and provably robust learning algorithms, and addressing the strategic aspects of machine learning.     Email : yucheng2 AT uic.edu    Office address : SEO 416, 851 S Morgan St, Chicago, IL 60607.    My CV and
