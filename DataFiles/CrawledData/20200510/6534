Consistent with this mission and Jane Addams’ Hull-House tradition, the PhD Program in Social Work responds to the urgent demand for more effective human services, the need for changes in social policy and the growth in social work education at all levels.  The program is designed to support the development of scholars of social and economic justice, providing students with the knowledge and skills for advancing social work treatment theory and research and for development and direction of social welfare programs. It provides for two broad research tracks: social planning, policy and administration, and social work practice scholarship within which a more specialized area of individualized study is selected.  The first cohort of students enrolled in 1973 and more than 120 persons have been awarded doctoral degrees since then. Most graduates of the program either teach in colleges and universities or hold positions as agency executives. Smaller numbers are working in research positions, with a very few in direct practice. Students are prepared for leadership in one or more of the following careers:   Teaching in colleges or universities  Conducting and directing research  Administrating large-scale social welfare programs  Analyzing and advising on social policy        Program Options      Full-time Study  A full-time student enrolls for a minimum of 12 semester hours per term. However, an optimal full-time load is considered to be 14 hours per term, in order to complete the program within 3 years.  Part-time Study  The option of beginning the program on a part-time basis is available to holders of the Master of Social Work. Initially, a part-time student may take less than 12 hours of credit per term, usually 6 per term. Part-time students will be expected to start their programs of study with the core courses especially designed for the Doctoral Program in Social Work. There are no special course offerings in the College of Social Work for PhD students in the summer session.

Jane Addams has equipped me to confidently and competently step into a career of research, advocacy, and teaching.”    Janae Bonsu | Doctoral Student          “Students that attend the Jane Addams PhD program will participate in a well-designed program that will equip them with the skills and experiences they will need to work in many different environments, doing many different kinds of jobs.”    Stephanie Schmitz Bechteler, PhD ’15 | Vice President and Executive Director, Research & Policy Center at the Chicago Urban League          “In my three years in the program, I benefited from continuous support and guidance, including when applying for awards and scholarships, preparing for presentations, and conducting my dissertation.”    Susanny J. Beltran, PhD '19 | Assistant Professor at University of Central Florida          “In Jane Addams’ doctoral program, I have been fortunate to work with well-respected researchers, teach a master’s level course, and gain service experience as a student representative on the doctoral committee.”    Andrew I.
