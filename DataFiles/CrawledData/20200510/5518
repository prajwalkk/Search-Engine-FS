If you have additional questions or require clarification, please contact UIC HR at 312.996.0840 or uichrwelcomecenter@uic.edu .      1.	Do employees who traveled to a different country need to check in with anyone before returning to work?         SVDA    Did the employee travel to a level 3 country?   Per the guidance issued by the President of the University, the Chancellor and Systems HR, employees should not be allowed to return to the workplace until medically cleared to do so. Employees need to immediately consult with a medical professional and only return to the workplace once cleared to do so by a medical professional. Contact University Health Service. UHS will verify the information and make recommendations.  If self-isolating/quarantine is recommended, the Work Status Report will indicate either off work for 14 days from the last of last day of exposure, or work from home if approved by the supervisor.  UHS will also advise on seeking treatment by their primary care provider if needed.  When the self-isolating/quarantine period has ended, the employee can again call UHS for a phone screen to be returned to work.  At that time a new Work Status Report will be generated and sent to the supervisor.           2.	Can employees claim Worker’s Compensation if they are exposed to COVID-19 at work?         VDV   We have been anticipating receiving workers’ compensation (WC) claims in relation to the spread of the coronavirus. I am providing a category of employees and a description of why they may be eligible for Workers’ Compensation coverage.  The IL Workers Compensation Act does provide occupational diseases coverage for employees. In this case, the Coronavirus would be considered an occupational disease, therefore, the below will only address coverage as it pertains to the Occupational disease section of the Act.  Health Care Field – We consider this category as front-line employee’s. This includes: Physicians, Nurses, Technicians and anyone who provides direct patient care.   Front-line medical professionals will most definitely be covered under the IL Workers’ Compensation Act for occupational disease because their exposure is greater than that of the general population. A direct exposure can be proven.  All other employee’s working in the health care facility. This includes: BSWs, Police Officers (security), etc. If a direct exposure is established, for example: cleaning a patient’s room who was later diagnosed as having the virus and no PPE (personal protection equipment) was worn. They would be covered by Workers’ Compensation.   Non-Health Care: This includes all employees.   In most cases, non-health care employees are not covered by the IL workers’ compensation occupational disease act. For the claim to be accepted, the employee must show that there only exposure occurred at work and not the general population. The work environment had to have placed them at a greater risk than that of the general population. In these cases, workers’ compensation would not be paid unless the exposure was determined to be work related.   Employees working from home: These employees would not be entitled to workers’ compensation for an occupational disease.  In an effort to be consistent in applying WC benefits we recommend that first visits be paid on behalf of all personnel working in locations where patient care is provided – UI Hospital, University Health Services, McKinley, etc.  At this time we plan to take the approach that subsequent bills will not be paid until it is determined the contamination was work-related (direct contact with a person known to be infected for example).  In keeping with the normal practice for exposure-type claims, first visits for employees in non-healthcare providing locations will not be paid.        3.	Can supervisors/leadership mandate staff not come to work if illness is not confirmed?         SDGS    Under normal circumstances, if leadership would have sent an employee home who is exhibiting illness symptoms this would be no different.  Employees who are exhibiting concerning health symptoms should be sent for evaluations.         4.	Do employees who traveled domestically, and who show no signs of symptoms, need to check in with anyone before returning to work?         CVSDV   There should be no restrictions on returning to work. However, HR would advise employees to seek advice from a medical professional or to contact University Health Services. UHS will verify the information and make recommendations.  If self-isolating/quarantine is recommended, the Work Status Report will indicate either off work for 14 days from the last of last day of exposure, or work from home if approved by the supervisor.  UHS will also advise on seeking treatment by their primary care provider if needed.  When the self-isolating/quarantine period has ended, the employee can again call UHS for a phone screen to be returned to work.  At that time a new Work Status Report will be generated and sent to the supervisor.        5.	Employee has been instructed to self-quarantine by University Health Services or by a medical professional.         SVZV    How does the supervisor/manager record the time off?   The University will allow all employees who are under quarantine/self-isolation due to COVID-19 to be paid during that time. If the employee is ill, they must record time off as sick leave.    What happens if the employee does not have enough time in their leave bank?   Civil Service employees may contact their department and/or college HR officer to apply for a Special Leave of Absence.           6. I feel ill or I may have been exposed to COVID-19 and do not know if I should come to work?         fsawef   Contact a medical provider and your supervisor.        7. How will leave time be recorded?         wfa   Employees who are not reporting to work will be assigned by their supervisor to work remotely and will not be required to document benefit time. Employees who have been asked to work remotely and are unable to do so may be required to document leave time.
