The ACM will be holding elections for the Fall 2017 term on Tuesday, March 28th, 2017 at 5:30PM in the CS Lounge (SELE 2268). Whether you want to help run the ACM as a Council member or just participate in activities, come share your voice and vote for who you want to lead the ACM. Light refreshments will be served.  If you are interested in running for a position, please fill out the candidate submission form here: https://goo.gl/forms/YH2Rd4jexYNrrPb82 and read the ACM constitution.  Candidate statements will be available starting Monday, March 13th, 2017. Candidate statements can be found here: goo.gl/fRu4aR and will be updated as needed.  ACM Elections for the Fall 2017 Term Date: Tuesday, March 28th, 2017 Time: 5:30PM Where: CS Lounge (SELE 2268)  If you have any questions, email the officers at officers@acm.cs.uic.edu.  + + + + FAQ + + + + What are the requirements to vote? You must be a member of the UIC chapter (local chapter) of the ACM to vote. If you would like to join the ACM before elections, please stop by our office in SELE 2264. If you are not a member, you will not be allowed at the elections meeting. You must be a member of ACM to run for a position.  What are the requirements for running for an officer position? You must be a member of the UIC chapter (local chapter) of the ACM to run for a position. You should be ready to take on the responsibility of any position(s) you run for. You can run for multiple positions, but you may only be elected for one position. If elected, you must become a member of National ACM immediately. Membership for National ACM is ~$19 per year. You can find out more at acm.org.  What elected positions are open? The President is the head of the ACM. You should run with a vision for where you want to see the ACM go. The President is responsible for staying informed of what is going on in the ACM, knowing how people view the ACM and enacting decisions accordingly. You will communicate with university officials as well ACM members/interested newcomers; you should communicate professionally and amicably as appropriately.  The Vice President is the second in command of the ACM. You work with the President to manage the ACM. You can run for Vice President if you want to manage the ACM on a high level but do not feel comfortable holding the head responsibility of running the ACM.  The Treasurer is responsible for tracking and maintaining the budget of the ACM. You should be comfortable managing money, working with university officials, and making budget decisions. If you are not completely comfortable with these tasks yet but willing to learn, that works too.  I don't want to run for an elected officer position, but I want to get involved/help manage X in the ACM. What can I do? Joining the ACM Council in an appointed position could be the option for you. Appointed Council members help with anything and everything such as LAN party planning, system administration, SIGs, mailing list secretarial management, and even starting new endeavors like hosting programming competitions and hackathons. If there is something you want to start in the ACM or just want to find out how you can help, talk to the officers and come to elections to meet the new officers!  - Jackie T.
