The cost for these services is recovered through a per FTE rate.  Self-supported: These services are not universally used or needed by all faculty and staff, such as: automated call systems; backup services for servers; cellular service; data and voice installs, moves and changes; incident tracking system; digital signage; IT event support; high performance computing; printing services; special circuits; specialized consulting and support; storage services (beyond basic bundle); and virtual servers. The cost for these services is recovered through recharge rates for individual services as requested by the customer. Rates can be found through each self-supported service offering.  University: These services support students, instruction, and related academic activities, including: some network services, infrastructure services (applications, database, communications), classroom technology, and learning management systems. The cost for these services is funded through central appropriations.   Rate and Funding Review Process  As the rate gets reviewed and approved every year, a central review process evaluates the services included in the bundle, prior year spending, projected future costs, changes in FTE, any subsidies that may be available, and any other factors that might affect the rate. This process ensures that centrally provided ACCC services can be sustained and enhanced as expected for a Research 1 institution.  In the fall, the recharge rate for the future fiscal year is developed with input from the Rate and Funding Review Committee and the Steering Committee. Once this rate is evaluated and approved by the Policy Committee, details about the rate are distributed and reviewed during budget meetings with each college/unit. An expense transfer will be made once a year around the second quarter of the fiscal year to collect funding from each college/unit.  See FAQs related to the ACCC Rate and Funding.
