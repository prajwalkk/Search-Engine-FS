On May 16, UIC will host virtual ceremonies for individual colleges via MarchingOrder.com. The online platform allows graduates to view speeches from administrators and keynotes and to be individually recognized for their accomplishments.  Please know that these virtual events are in no way intended to replace the in-person ceremonies to which we were all looking forward. At the same time, we recognize that it may not be possible for all of our graduates to attend the rescheduled ceremonies. UIC is proud of all of our graduates and their accomplishments, and we invite all spring 2020 graduates to celebrate with us online in May, in person this summer, or both.  Graduates from the College of Medicine will not be participating.  A separate virtual ceremony is scheduled for May 8 for those graduates, and communications will be coming directly from the college.  We will provide information regarding the in-person ceremonies as it becomes available.  For more information, visit the UIC commencement website .
