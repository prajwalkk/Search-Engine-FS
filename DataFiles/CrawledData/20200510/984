The Issues     Learn About the Issues    The cost of journals are increasingly outpacing library budgets and limiting access to research. Copyright is also an issue as scholars relinquish control of their own work by signing over intellectual property rights. Dissatisfaction with the existing scholarly communication system has led to the development of new publishing models, including open access and digital repositories.

The fulfillment of this promise will be determined, however, by the choices researchers and scholars make today about where and how they publish. The below brochure outlines some of the issues related to disseminating eScholarship; identifies ways faculty can effectively manage the rights to and dissemination of their work; and describes resources and services available to the UIC community for managing, sharing, promoting, and measuring impact of scholarship and the underlying data.
