Psychology currently has 28 tenure-track faculty, 4 Clinical assistant professors, 2 research professors and 8 lecturers. The Department of Psychology offers degrees oriented to understanding the complete human being across different levels of analysis that include the brain, the mind (cognitive and affective processes), the person (individual emotional and attitudinal patterns), the group and community (how members relate to each other and how individual group experience is impacted by cultural and community context). The central goal of the undergraduate and graduate training experience is to provide a contemporary, comprehensive and challenging exploration in understanding the complete human being.
