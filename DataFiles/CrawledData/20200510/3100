individuals who have already completed the OIS H-1B application process with a
UIC sponsoring department.    Apply for a Visa  Prepare for Life at UIC  Arrival at the U.S. Port-of-Entry  Check In at OIS  Other Considerations  Apply for a Visa  In order to apply for your H-1B
    visa (and H-4 dependent visas) you will need to schedule a visa appointment at
    a U.S. Consulate or Embassy (it is recommend that you apply for a visa in your
    home country, if possible.) At your appointment, you will present your
    original Form I-797 (mailed to you from OIS), as well as the copies of the LCA
    and form I-129 that are part of the H-1B application process. Review the U.S.
    Department of State’s information on U.S. visas
    for employment . They list detailed information about the
    process and which documents to bring to your interview. The Consulate is
    required to verify your H-1B approval in the “PIMS” database. Once the visa is
    granted and stamped in your passport you are ready to make travel arrangements
    to the United States.  Canadian citizens only : You do not
    need an H-1B visa, but you must still present the documents sent to you by OIS,
    or pre-flight inspection station. In order to enter the United States, you must
    have a passport identifying you as a Canadian citizen. Also, be sure that the
    officer issues you a Form I-94 for H-1B status (see below).   Prepare for Life at UIC   The Life in
    Illinois and Resources sections of the OIS website have a variety of information to help you prepare
    for your arrival in Chicago. Information includes: climate, currency, public
    transportation, housing, and other topics. You may also find the Life at UIC links on the main
    UIC homepage helpful in navigating employee benefits, calendars, technology,
    health and safety issues, and transportation.     Arrival at the U.S. Port-of-Entry   Arrival date : YOU
    MAY ONLY ENTER THE U.S. UP TO 10 DAYS BEFORE THE START DATE ON YOUR H-1B I-797
    APPROVAL NOTICE. An immigration officer at the Port of Entry may refuse
    you admission if you arrive before this time.  Inspection at U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) : Upon arrival you must present your passport and
    Form I-797 to the immigration officer. The officer may ask you for
    additional information, such as a copy of your UIC job offer letter. The
    officer will stamp your passport and enter you into the CBP arrival/departure database . This entry will be
    known as your “Form I-94” or “Admission Number.” Please make sure that the
    entry stamp and Form I-94 indicate “H-1B” and that the end date corresponds
    with your Form I-797, or with an additional 10 days added. If you are entering
    with H-4 dependents, make sure their documents indicate “H-4” not “H-1B.”  Customs :
    Review the CBP website for information on items that may be restricted or prohibited from entering the
    U.S.     Check In at OIS   In order to begin your
    employment at UIC, you will need to visit OIS. Call or email us to
    schedule a check-in appointment. Please bring your passport, original Form
    I-797, and Form I-94 printout.  Also, please be ready to provide a U.S.
    address, even if it is a temporary address.     Other Considerations   Delayed entry :
    If your visa is delayed at the Consulate, or if there are other unforeseen
    occurrences which will prevent you from beginning your employment on time,
    please relay that information to your UIC department contact and OIS.  Dependents : A
    dependent is a spouse or child under the age of 21. Dependents are
    considered “H-4s.”  Your H-4s will not need a separate I-797 approval
    notice if they are accompanying you to the U.S. Please note, it is possible to
    have your dependents join you in the U.S. at a later time.      xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
