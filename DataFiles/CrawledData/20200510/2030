FAQ | Guaranteed Admissions Transfer | The University of Illinois at Chicago    The University of Illinois at Chicago     GAT  Eligibility & Requirements  Involvement  Participation Form  Find my GAT Advisor  STAR Scholarship  STEM  FAQ          Frequently Asked Questions    What are the benefits of being in the GAT program?    The benefits of the GAT program are numerous, but to name a few:   You will be guaranteed a spot at UIC within the degree program of your choosing.  You will receive transfer counseling from your UIC GAT Coordinator to ensure you are taking the right steps and are on-track to transfer.  You will be assigned an academic advisor at UIC within the college that you intend to enroll.  You will have a clear course pathway into UIC programs  You will be invited to participate in events both on your campus and ours that focus on GAT students.  You will receive your admission decision sooner than most transfer students applying for the same semester.  You will have access to UIC’s recreation facility, library, support programs and more.  You will receive monthly newsletters informing you of different opportunities to visit campus, scholarship opportunities, workshops, special events, basic instructions on how and when to apply to UIC and the Honors College and so much more!       Does it matter that I am an international or undocumented student?    Your citizenship status has no bearing on whether or not you can participate in this program. As long as you are a full-time student at any one of the seven City Colleges of Chicago and you meet the GAT requirements we would love to have you join us as a member of the next GAT cohort.      If I participate in the GAT program but am an undocumented or international STAR Scholar will I still receive the UIC Star Scholarship?    Unfortunately, international and undocumented star scholars are not eligible to receive the UIC Star Scholarship however, if you are qualified for the GAT program you are most definitely invited to participate and transfer into UIC with guaranteed admission.      Why do I have to complete a participation form?    The participation form gives UIC permission to begin contacting you in regards to transfer and allows us to send regular emails with updates and other important information. Without your permission we are unable to contact you.      If I do participate in the program am I locked into coming to UIC?    The participation form is not your application to UIC so you are not locked into coming to UIC. You have at least 1 year from the signing of your participation form to decide if UIC is the right place for you. This is why we invite you to come meet with some key individuals on campus so that we can help you learn more about us and get a better feel for what life is like as a student at UIC.      What happens if my GPA falls below a 3.0 when I apply to UIC?    No need to worry. Sometimes things happen that may affect your GPA causing it to transfer over to UIC under the required 3.0. As long as you have submitted everything that we ask for, your application will be added in with the other transfer applications and you will then be considered along with all other transfer students for a spot in your chosen field of study. This means you are no longer guaranteed a spot and will be required to compete with other applicants for entry into UIC.      What if I transfer before receiving my associate’s degree?    We have this all worked out. Although we strongly encourage you to complete your associates degree before you transfer to UIC, if you do happen to leave CCC and you are still missing a class or two it is possible to do what we call a “reverse transfer". In other words, you would complete those last few courses during your first year at UIC and with your permission, we will send a copy of your UIC transcript with your final grades back to your community college so that you may then be awarded your associates degree. You will want to work with your advisors at both schools to ensure this option will work for you.      What if I have coursework at a college or university other than CCC?    If you have previous college coursework outside of CCC you are not eligible for the GAT program. However, you are still more than welcome to apply as a transfer student.      What if I’m not qualified for GAT or I wish to apply for a degree that is not part of GAT?    If you do not qualify for GAT you will want to follow your transferology guide so you can be sure that you are taking the courses required for your degree program at UIC. This ensures that when you are ready to apply you may simply apply as a transfer student through our regular transfer process. It will also be very helpful for you to meet with your academic advisor at your community college as well.      How do I get started?    Meet with your CCC academic advisor and complete the participation form.     Last modified: July 14, 2017 03:36pm.
