The behavior is considered hazing if it is: (a) inconsistent with the purpose or protocol of the organization; (b) not sanctioned or authorized by the University; (c) humiliating, degrading, or risks emotional and/or physical harm; and (d) unreasonably interferes with academic or social activities or success. Silent participation or acquiescence in the presence of hazing are NOT neutral acts; they are violations of this section.”      Examples of activities that could be considered hazing include:        forced cleaning    forced wear of embarrassing clothing      running errands/menial tasks    depriving you of regular hygiene practices (brushing teeth, bathing)      forced interviews    making you steal or destroy property      scavenger hunts    “drop-offs” or “dumps” in unfamiliar locations      mental and/or psychological abuse    being duct taped or some other physical restraints      public or private displays of humiliation    violence      forced use of alcohol or drugs    sexual assault      providing alcohol to minors    beating      use of alcohol or drugs during the new member education/intake process or other membership events    kicking      line-ups    calisthenics      forced eating or drinking of items    creation of excessive fatigue      being yelled at or cursed at by other members of the team or group    any activity which seriously endangers the health or safety of another individual      sleep deprivation    public nudity           To help you identify whether something is hazing or not, ask yourself the questions below.  If you answer “yes” to any of these questions, the activity is probably hazing.    Am I being asked to keep these activities a secret?  Does participation violate my values or those of my organization?  Is this activity causing emotional distress or stress of any kind to others or myself?  Does the activity risk emotional or physical harm/abuse?  Would I feel comfortable participating in this activity if my parents, professor, coach or university official were watching?  Would I object to this activity being photographed for the school newspaper or filmed by the local TV news crew?  If someone were injured, would I feel comfortable being investigated by the police or insurance carrier?  Would we get in trouble if the Dean of Students walked by?  Am I doing anything illegal?
