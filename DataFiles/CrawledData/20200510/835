An employer shall provide a private space, other than a bathroom, where an employee can express her milk on an as needed basis.  In accordance with Illinois School Code – Breastfeeding Accommodations for Pupils, lactating students will be provided with a reasonable amount of time to express breast milk (or breastfeed an infant child). Lactating students shall not incur an academic penalty for using the reasonable accommodation to express breast milk during the school day.       Compensation   Nursing mothers shall be paid for break time needed for nursing or expressing milk. The break time may run concurrently with any break time already established. Nursing mothers are also entitled to a reasonable number of additional paid breaks to allow to them to nurse or express milk. Departments shall provide reasonable break time as needed by the employee unless doing so would create an undue hardship as defined by the Illinois Human Rights Act. Supervisors are asked to contact their university or system human resources office before denying an employee a paid break for expressing milk based on the undue hardship exclusion.
