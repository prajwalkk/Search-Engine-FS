Graduates of our doctoral nurse practitioner programs become authoritative family and psychiatric mental health nurse practitioners. In the case of our DNP degrees in advanced population health and health systems leadership and informatics, our graduates go on to roles as health systems leaders. Our PhD candidates graduate, prepared to expand the universe of nursing research and to educate the next generation of nurses and nurse scientists.  The department also offers the School Nurse Certificate Program to prepare bachelor’s prepared registered nurses to become school nurse leaders.      Our department is home to these academic programs:        Family Nurse Practitioner          Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner          Advanced Population Health Nursing          Health Systems Leadership and Informatics          School Nurse Certificate Program           Meet the department head      Colleen Corte, PhD, RN, FAAN  Associate Professor  Director of the PhD Program  Colleen Corte has been an educator and researcher since 2004. In addition to serving as Department Head, she is also director of the PhD program.  Her talents as a teacher and a mentor to her doctoral students led to her receipt of a UIC Teaching Recognition Program award in 2016 and the UIC Graduate College Mentoring award in 2017.  In her own reserach, Corte addresses prevention of the development of alcohol use disorders by inhibiting the formation of a “drinker identity”—a powerful predictor of alcohol use of which she has found evidence in children as young as 9 years old. Corte most recently extended her research to focus on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people because of their higher prevalence of heavy drinking and alcohol problems.  Corte is a fellow in the American Academy of Nursing and has received accolades and awards from the International Nurses Society on Addictions, the Midwest Nursing Research Society and the Research Society on Alcoholism.
