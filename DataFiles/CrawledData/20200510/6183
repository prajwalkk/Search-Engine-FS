More Resources    HVAC Information and Updates          Building History    In the College’s previous Wood Street building, its home from 1937 to 1972, students sat in cavernous lecture halls for their classes and performed clinical work in laboratories on each of the building’s nine floors. Instruments and equipment were kept in lockers in the basement, and to get to the clinics on time with heavy cases of equipment on one of only two elevators was a daily struggle. The lack of air conditioning made learning, patient care, and the setting of impression materials a challenge.  Dean Seymour H. Yale, ’45, had a better idea. He secured Federal funds for and was the driving force behind the design of the College’s current building at 801 S. Paulina St., which opened in 1972. In 1972, Phase I of the 330,000 square foot College of Dentistry building opened at 801 S. Paulina Street. Phase II opened in 1975. The building was constructed for $22 million, with virtually all funding coming from the Federal government.       Make a Gift                           The University of Illinois at Chicago College of Dentistry is a worldwide leader in oral health education, clinical care and research that is patient-centered and evidence-based, with a foundation in preventive and public health sciences.
