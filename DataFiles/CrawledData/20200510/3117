These activities have been  determined to require at least a baccalaureate (bachelor’s) degree or  appropriate credentials demonstrating status of a professional. (See  list below of “USCIS Definitions of Business Activities at a  Professional Level” admissible under the NAFTA agreement.)  A person entering the U.S. with this status can apply for a length of stay for up to three years. No maximum limit on the number of extensions has been  established under the provisions of the NAFTA agreement. Dependents of a  person holding TN status will request TD status. TD status does not  allow work authorization.  Some basic information is summarized below. For more detailed information, please visit the Department of State website: http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1274.html     Procedure to Hire a TN    The UIC academic department should issue a letter to the visitor  including the information: (A sample letter is provided below.)  business activity in which to be engaged  anticipated length of stay  salary  statement regarding the degree and licensing requirements for the position  mention of the application fee to be paid at the port of entry or time of application for TN status      If the applicant is a Mexican citizen he or she must take this  letter and additional information to a U.S. Consulate in Mexico in order  to apply for a TN entry visa. If the applicant is Canadian, he or she  will not need to apply for an entry visa.    At the port-of-entry the applicant should present the following:  Evidence of citizenship  TN visa, if Mexican  Copies of diplomas, degrees, or transcripts (to demonstrate that educational requirements are met)  Letter from hiring department (see sample below)  $50 application fee  Applicant must be otherwise admissible under current immigration law.      Once the individual enters the U.S. in TN status, he or she must check-in with OIS . He or she should bring their I-94 (card or printout), passport, and a copy of the letter  used to apply for TN status. Check-ins for TN may be done at any time. There is no need to meet with an advisor. Alternately, the documents  may be scanned to ois@uic.edu for a “virtual check-in.”     It is possible to apply for an extension of TN status. This should be done before the expiry of their current I-94. One may choose to travel and  reenter the U.S. (reapplying at the port-of-entry), or the process may  be completed in our office and they may remain present in the U.S. until  a USCIS decision is issued. If the latter option is chosen, the  department must complete a TN Request Form and submit the required  documents and fees. Contact our office for a copy of this form.
