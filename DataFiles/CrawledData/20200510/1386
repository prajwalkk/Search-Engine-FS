The OFCCP enforces Executive Order 11246; Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and the affirmative action provisions of Section 4212 of the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act. Collectively, these legal mandates prohibit discrimination and require Federal contractors and subcontractors to take affirmative action to ensure equal opportunities for employment, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or status as a Vietnam era or special veteran.  As part of its Affirmative Action efforts, OAE oversees UIC's Academic Hiring process in the areas related to Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action, including reviewing and approving searches, analyzing employment data and assisting with recruitment plans to attract applicants from under-represented groups.
