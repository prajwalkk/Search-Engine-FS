Check here for COVID-19 related updates .  Visiting students need to apply and be admitted before they can register. Admitted visiting students can check their Time Ticket online. Your Time Ticket tells you the earliest date and time that you can register.  Your Time Ticket will be available for viewing soon after you are admitted, and registration for summer courses begins in late April.  The information below will take you through registration step by step, and some common registration issues that may arise. If you have any additional registration questions, please don’t hesitate to contact us .    + Activating Your Login  As a UIUC/UIS student, you already have a NetID that you use on your home campus. However, in order to register for classes at UIC, you must activate your UIC NetID and set up a UIC e-mail account or e-mail forwarding. Please note that this will often end up being the same as it is at your home campus, but you are still required to activate it.  Approximately three days after you are admitted to Summer Session, you will receive a “UIC account activation process” email that will contain your University Identification Number (UIN) and your Token, which you will use to activate your UIC NetID. Activating your NetID will help prepare you to register. You will need your NetID to access various services throughout the semester. If you cannot find your email with your UIN and Token, contact us .  Once you’ve activated your NetID, you will be able to login to the my.UIC.edu portal to view your Registration Time Ticket. You will use your NetID to log in to the my.UIC.edu where you will check your registration eligibility and register for classes.    + Forget your Login ID or Password?  If you forget your NetID, you can look it up using the UIC Directory .  Click here for help if you forgot your password for your NetID . You also can go to an ACCC computer lab and a lab consultant will assist you.    + Checking Your Time Ticket  Admitted visiting students can check their Time Tickets online to find out the earliest date and time that they can register during Open Registration. Time Tickets will be viewable in the my.UIC.edu portal once you activate your NetID. Please note that all Time Tickets are listed in Central Standard Time (CST).   In order to check your Time Ticket, you need to activate your NetID .  Go to my.UIC.edu .  Using your NetID and password, log in either by clicking on “Sign In” or “Login.” If you encounter issues with logging in to the portal, please contact us .  After you have logged in, use the search bar to find results for “XE Registration” or scroll through the page to find this portlet.  After you click on “XE Registration,” select “Prepare for Registration” to view your Time Ticket and to find out if you have any holds.     + How to Register  Visiting students need to apply and be admitted before they can register. You will be able to view your Time Ticket  in the my.UIC.edu portal soon after you’re admitted. Please note that you must use the UIC system to register for your summer classes. You cannot register through your home campus registration system.  You can register online anytime after your appointed time by going to my.UIC.edu . This system is available 24 hours a day, except from 6 a.m. – 12 p.m. on Sundays.  Assistance is available online. Student Self-Service provides instructions for each step of the registration process, and online Help screens can be found in the upper right hand corner of each screen.  Steps to Register:  For more detailed information that includes screen shots of the registration process, view Step-by-Step Registration Instructions .   Go to my.UIC.edu .  Using your NetID and password, log in either by clicking on “Sign In” or “Login.”  After you have logged in, use the search bar to find results for “XE Registration” or scroll through the page to find this portlet.  After you click on “XE Registration,” select “Prepare for Registration” to view your Time Ticket (your appointed time to register) and to find out if you have any holds.  To return to the main menu, click on the “Home” icon or “Banner Self-Service.”  From the main menu, you can click on “Register for Classes.” You can also “Browse Classes” and “View Class Scheduler” to build a preferred schedule.  When you are searching for courses, you can use “Advanced Search” to narrow your search to courses in a specific session. For courses in the 4-week session, enter “Summer Session 1” in the field labeled “Part of Term.” For courses in the 8-week session, enter “Summer Session 2.” If you do not make a selection for Part of Term, your search results will include courses offered in both sessions. You will need to pay attention to the start date and end date of each section to identify when it meets. Courses in the 4-week session will have a date range of “05/18/2020 – 06/12/2020” and courses in the 8-week session will specify “06/15/2020 – 08/07/2020.”  If you wish to register in a linked section, you must register for both parts of the course simultaneously by checking the box corresponding to the lecture and lab or discussion.  After you have registered, be sure to view your schedule. We recommend printing a copy for your records.   If the courses you need are filled, require an override or have course restrictions, contact us for further assistance.    + Immunization Requirements  As a visiting student, you may be required to submit immunization records if you meet certain criteria. Please visit our Immunization Requirements page for more information.    + Full-Time Credit Hours  Undergraduate students must be registered for 6 credit hours in the summer to be considered a full-time student.  Please note that being a full-time student is determined by the total number of credit hours that you’re enrolled in over the entire summer, regardless of whether you enroll in the 4-week session only, the 8-week session only, or both sessions.    + Maximum Credit Hours  Undergraduate students can register for up to 12 total credit hours–either as a combination of courses taken in the 4-week and 8-week sessions, or just courses taken in the 8-week session.  If you wish to register for more than 12 credit hours, please contact the Registration Help Line at (312) 996-8600 when you are registering and request permission to register for the additional hours.  Because of the intensive nature of the 4-week session, students are advised to only register for one course.    + Linked Course Sections  Linked Course Required If you receive this message, then one of the courses you are registering for has additional sections that are “linked.”  This could be a lecture section, lab, quiz, or discussion section.  These screen shots have detailed step-by-step instructions on how to properly register for linked courses .  If you received a Linked Course error message, then you may have made one of the following errors.   Did you register for all sections of the course? For example, (Lecture + Lab) or (Lecture + Discussion). If you didn’t, then the missing section should be included in the error message itself.  For example, if the error message reads “AL required” or “(AL),” then you need to also find the CRN and register for a section that has starts with “AL” in the Sec Column.  Did you pick a valid linked section pairing for the course you are registering?  For example, Lecture AL1 paired with Discussion AD 1, 2, or 3 is valid, but Lecture AL1 paired with Discussion BD 1, 2, or 3 is not a valid pairing.     + Course Prerequisites  A number of UIC courses have prerequisites, which are listed when you search the course schedule . Course prerequisites apply to all students, including visiting UIUC/UIS students.  Generally, visiting students do not need to provide a transcript verifying that they have met prerequisites. However, if you register for a course that has prerequisites, your instructor may ask you for verification. To provide for this possibility, bring a copy of your grade report or transcript with you to the first day of class.  There are certain courses with prerequisites that require a special override for you to register. You can check which courses require an override or contact the Summer Session Office.  If you have questions about whether your previous coursework fulfills a course prerequisite, please contact the department offering the course for which you plan to register. You can access departmental contact information online or contact us .    + Restricted Courses  While most courses are available to all students, some courses have restrictions which limit registration to students meeting certain criteria, e.g., college, major, classification, or placement test scores. Course restrictions are noted when you search the course schedule .  For example, priority registration for Art and Design courses is given to UIC students in that major. However, visiting students can register for Art and Design courses during Late Registration (see Key Dates ) if space is available. For a limited number of courses, registration is only open to students who are part of that program.  When you search the course schedule and it indicates that a course has restrictions but the list of eligible student groups includes “Summer Session,” the course is available to Summer Session Only and Intercampus Registration students. Please note that some students who applied through Intercampus Registration may encounter additional restrictions. Please contact us if you need any assistance during registration.    + Courses Requiring Permission to Register  When you search the course schedule and it indicates registration for a course requires permission of the instructor or the academic department, please contact us for assistance.    + Closed/Open Course Sections  If a section in which you are trying to register is closed, choose the “Look-up or Select Classes” menu option while you are logged in to my.UIC.edu . You can enter the course you want to see if there are seats available in other sections. Please contact us  if you have any questions.    + Registration Policies and Procedures  Before registering, we suggest you review the detailed UIC Registration Policies and Procedures .    + Credit/No Credit Option  If you are interested in taking a class as credit/no credit, contact us for information.    + Auditing  As a visiting student, you may audit a class , but you will first need to get permission from the instructor of the class (on or after the first day of classes) and from the dean of the college concerned.  You will also need to fill out a Visitor Permit form (available from the Office of Registration and Records) by the end of the first week of the term for the summer session. There is a charge for auditing a class.    + Registration Error Messages  If you have a problem registering, call the Registration Help Line at (312) 996-8600 or the Summer Session Office at (312) 996-9099.  If you receive an error message while registering for courses, then you will not be registered for these courses until you correct the errors and resubmit the changes. Below are common error messages you may receive when registering.
