UIC’s mission is:   To create knowledge that transforms our views of the world and, through sharing and application, transforms the world.  To provide a wide range of students with the educational opportunity only a leading research university can offer.  To address the challenges and opportunities facing not only Chicago but all Great Cities of the 21st century, as expressed by our Great Cities Commitment.  To foster scholarship and practices that reflect and respond to the increasing diversity of the U.S. in a rapidly globalizing world.  To train professionals in a wide range of public service disciplines, serving Illinois as the principal educator of health science professionals and as a major healthcare provider to underserved communities.   Overview  The University of Illinois at Chicago is a major research university offering the unique cultural, business, and entertainment opportunities synonymous with a world-class city. UIC ranks alongside University of Chicago and Northwestern University as one of the top research-funded institutions in the nation. In many ways, UIC discovers what other institutions teach. UIC is comprised of 15 academic colleges including the UIC College of Medicine, which educates one in six Illinois physicians and is the largest medical school in the nation.  UIC boasts one of the most diverse student bodies in the country, offering a cultural experience second to none with more than 20,000 undergraduate and 10,000 graduate and professional students.  On our 240-acre, eco-friendly campus, students will find 100 buildings, 5,000 trees, geothermal energy plants, and two state-of-the-art fitness centers. And whether living in residence hall, near campus or commuting, students enjoy a busy social life. With nationally ranked athletic teams, numerous social events, sororities and fraternities, and nearby entertainment venues, there are a lot of opportunities to have fun.  To learn about UIC's leadership and role as one of three campuses of the University of Illinois, please consult the following web pages: Chancellor and Leadership and the University of Illinois .  The Faculty  The university takes great pride in its faculty. Many of its members have gained national and international reputations as scholars and researchers, artists, writers, clinicians, and educators.  The quality of UIC faculty members is measured by the recognition they receive through publications, national awards, and the level of grant support for their research and teaching. For example, faculty members have earned awards, fellowships, and grant support from such sources as the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the National Academy of Science, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Sloan Foundation, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Department of Education, and many other philanthropic organizations and state and federal agencies.  UIC faculty researchers are actively engaged in their disciplines and constantly working to advance their areas of study and students benefit directly as the latest trends and insights are brought into the classroom. Research faculty guide advanced undergraduate and graduate students and provide them with research opportunities that may inspire them to enter research careers themselves. Publication of books and articles is another key measure of faculty strength and UIC’s faculty is highly productive, with many holding editorships of prestigious journals. Their scholarship and practices reflect and respond to the increasing diversity of the United States as they create new knowledge both within the traditional disciplines and in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary endeavors.  Accreditation  Accreditation is the recognition that an institution maintains standards requisite for its graduates to gain admission to other reputable institutions of higher learning or to achieve credentials for professional practice. The goal of accreditation is to ensure that education provided by institutions of higher education meets acceptable levels of quality.  There are two basic types of educational accreditation, one identified as “institutional” and the other referred to as “specialized” or “programmatic.” Institutional accreditation normally applies to an entire institution, indicating that each of an institution’s parts is contributing to the achievement of the institution’s objectives.  Specialized accreditation normally applies to the evaluation of programs, departments, or schools which usually are parts of a total collegiate or other postsecondary institution. The unit accredited may be as large as a college or school within a university or as small as a curriculum within a discipline. Most of the specialized accrediting agencies review units within a postsecondary institution which is accredited by one of the regional accrediting commissions.  The University of Illinois at Chicago is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), one of the regional accrediting commissions in the United States.  The Higher Learning Commission (HLC) 230 South LaSalle Street, Suite 7-500 Chicago, Illinois 60604-1411 (312) 263-0456 info@hlcommission.org  https://www.hlcommission.org  The Higher Learning Commission is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education (USDE) and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). In 20017, HLC voted to continue accreditation of UIC for the maximum period of 10 years. The next comprehensive evaluation of UIC is scheduled for 2027-2028. Verification of accreditation status is available in the Office of the Chancellor (312) 413-3350 and at this HLC website .

While students from most states may enroll in online programs at UIC, there are some important limitations.  Out-of-state students interested in enrolling in a UIC online program or online courses should check the State Authorization webpage for more information about the states in which UIC is approved to offer distance education programs.
