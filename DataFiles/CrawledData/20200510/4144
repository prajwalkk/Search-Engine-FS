Note:  PHYS 141 and PHYS 142 are offered every semester (including summer session). All other physics courses are offered only in the semester indicated.  Note: Students must earn at least 40 advanced hours at a four-year college or university. These hours may include hours in the major.  Note: The UIC General Education Requirement is nine courses: Two laboratory courses from Analyzing the Natural World, one course from each of Understanding the Individual and Society, Understanding the Past, Understanding the Creative Arts, Exploring World Cultures, and Understanding U.S. Society. The two remaining General Education courses can be taken from any category. For example, taking CHEM 122 , CHEM 123 , CHEM 124 , CHEM 125   and PHYS 141 , PHYS 142 fulfills four of nine General Education courses and the Analyzing the Natural World category.
